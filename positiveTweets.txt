THIS MY THOUGHTS ON THIS 👇🏻

The rise of cryptocurrencies has revolutionized global finance, offering individuals and institutions new opportunities to participate in a dynamic, decentralized market. Among the most compelling avenues in this space is trading major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), Binance Coin ($BNB), and others. Here are the key benefits of engaging with these digital assets:  

1. High Liquidity

Major cryptocurrencies dominate trading volumes on global exchanges, ensuring high liquidity. This liquidity allows traders to enter and exit positions quickly, minimizing price slippage and enabling efficient execution of strategies. For investors, liquidity reduces risk and enhances price stability compared to lesser-known altcoins.  

2. 24/7 Market Access

Unlike traditional stock markets, cryptocurrency exchanges operate around the clock. This non-stop trading window accommodates global participants across time zones, offering flexibility to react to news, market trends, or macroeconomic events in real time.  

3. Transparency and Security

Blockchain technology underpins major cryptos, providing a transparent, immutable ledger of all transactions. This decentralization reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation by centralized entities. Additionally, established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum benefit from robust security protocols and widespread network validation.  

4. Volatility for Profit Potential

While volatility can be a double-edged sword, it creates opportunities for traders to capitalize on price fluctuations. Major cryptos often experience significant swings driven by market sentiment, regulatory updates, or technological advancements, enabling skilled traders to profit in both rising (long) and falling (short) markets.  

5. Portfolio Diversification

Cryptocurrencies have historically exhibited low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks, bonds, or commodities. Adding major cryptos to a portfolio can diversify risk and act as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, especially in uncertain economic climates.  

6. Global Accessibility

Crypto trading democratizes access to financial markets. With just an internet connection and a digital wallet, anyone can trade major coins, bypassing geographic restrictions or barriers common in traditional finance. This inclusivity empowers unbanked populations and fosters financial innovation.  

7. Lower Transaction Costs

Trading major cryptos often incurs lower fees compared to traditional financial systems, particularly for cross-border transactions. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and peer-to-peer platforms further reduce intermediary costs, making crypto an efficient medium for value transfer.  

8. Exposure to Innovation

Major cryptocurrencies are often tied to groundbreaking technologies. For example, Ethereum’s smart contracts power decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs, while Bitcoin serves as “digital gold.” Trading these assets allows investors to support and benefit from the growth of blockchain ecosystems.  

9. Institutional Adoption

Growing institutional interest in cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum has legitimized the market. Companies, hedge funds, and even governments are integrating crypto into their strategies, driving mainstream adoption and long-term value potential.  

10. Established Track Record

Leading cryptocurrencies have weathered market cycles, regulatory scrutiny, and technological challenges, proving their resilience. Their longevity instills confidence compared to newer, untested projects.  

It requires careful risk management, research, and an understanding of market dynamics. Do the job the right way. Enjoy this journey.

Many assume tokens are dead at this stage, but that’s actually where I see the opportunity.

To start hunting, you’ll need GMGN.

It’s also useful for trading, but I'll cover that later. Head to the NextBC section and apply the filters as shown in the video.

The filters will help identify tokens that have survived the initial pump but are now in a dump phase—these are the ones to watch.

However, this isn’t a guaranteed win.

Always check the community sentiment, analyze all social media activity, and conduct a full review of the token.

Don’t forget to inspect the Bubble Map, look for snipers, and run an analysis using @getmoni_io.

Also, search the token's ticker on Twitter—you might find people already shilling it.

Once you confirm the deal is safe and see strong community backing, time your entry wisely.

Save this post so you don’t lose it and keep uncovering hidden gems!

➜ "Meme mania" or "retail gambling" are terms used just to avoid seeing the hard truth...

Pump fun was never about decentralization or fun... but an insider-engineered liquidity heist! 💊

📊 Since its inception, the platform has processed $4.16B in transactions, raking in over 2.5M SOL ($500M+ in fees).

But instead of fueling innovation, that capital was extracted, dumped, and drained into oblivion.

🔧 Here’s how the heist worked:

➜ Create the Perfect Money Trap
A platform that lets anyone launch a token instantly, with a built-in 10% fee.
Market it as a meme revolution, but make sure the house always wins.

➜ Step 2: Liquidity Black Hole
With millions new tokens, Pump fun ensured no single altcoin could gain sustainable traction by diluting capital across infinite low-float casinos.

➜ Step 3: The Exit Dump
While retail chased the next 100x, the Pump fun team was quietly offloading SOL proceeds at scale.

➜ Step 4: The Rug, But Slow
No single token had to rug because the entire market structure itself was the rug.

💀 This was more than just market fragmentation... it was liquidity theft on an industrial scale.

Overview

What you’re describing—buying a security, heavily promoting it so that others buy in, and then selling as soon as the price goes up—colloquially falls under what is often called a “pump and dump” scheme. In the United States, such schemes generally violate the federal securities laws and can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Below are the primary laws and rules that cover this type of misconduct:

1. Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Section 10(b)
• What it is: Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a broad anti-fraud provision.
• Key point: It makes it unlawful to use or employ “any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

SEC Rule 10b-5
• What it is: Adopted under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5 is one of the most important tools the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses to combat fraud.
• Key point: It specifically prohibits (1) making any untrue statement of a material fact, (2) omitting to state a material fact necessary to make statements not misleading, and (3) engaging in any act, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.

How It Applies to “Pump and Dump”:
• If someone promotes a security with false or misleading information—or omits crucial negative information—to inflate the price artificially and then sells their stake at the inflated price, they can be liable under Rule 10b-5.

2. Securities Act of 1933

Section 17(a)
• What it is: Section 17(a) is another broad anti-fraud provision that applies to the offer or sale of securities.
• Key point: It prohibits fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation in the offer and sale of securities.

Section 17(b) (the “Touting” Provision)
• What it is: Sometimes called the “anti-touting” rule.
• Key point: Requires promoters and “influencers” to disclose the nature and amount of compensation they are receiving for promoting a security. Failing to disclose that you’re being paid to hype a security can violate Section 17(b), even if the promotional statements are not false on their face.

How It Applies to “Pump and Dump”:
• If an individual is paid to promote or tout a security without disclosing that fact, they can be violating Section 17(b).

3. Exchange Act Provisions on Manipulative Activities

Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act
• What it is: Prohibits transactions in a security that create actual or apparent active trading or affect the price of a security for the purpose of inducing others to buy or sell.
• Key point: Specifically targets market manipulation, such as wash trades, matched orders, or any scheme designed to artificially move a stock’s price.

How It Applies:
• Pump-and-dump schemes can involve orchestrated trades, mass promotional emails, social media blasts, etc., intended to create the false impression of strong market interest in a security.

4. Additional Considerations
• Civil vs. Criminal Liability:
• The SEC can bring civil charges for securities fraud (leading to fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and bans from serving as an officer/director of a public company).
• The Department of Justice (DOJ) can bring criminal charges for willful violations of the securities laws, which could include prison sentences.
• FINRA Rules (for broker-dealers):
• If a person is registered or associated with a broker-dealer, various FINRA rules (such as Rules 2020 and 5210) also prohibit manipulative, deceptive, or other fraudulent devices.

5. In Practice

A classic “pump and dump” scenario unfolds like this:
1. Accumulation: The perpetrator quietly acquires shares of a low-volume or penny stock.
2. Pump: The perpetrator hypes the stock—sometimes through social media, chat rooms, email newsletters, paid advertising, or false press releases—causing others to buy in.
3. Dump: Once enough buyers come in and the price spikes, the perpetrator sells their shares.
4. Price Crash: When the hype fades, the stock price usually collapses, leaving latecomers with big losses.

Under the laws discussed, regulators and prosecutors look for evidence of deceit or manipulation—e.g., false or misleading statements, undisclosed compensation, or schemes to artificially inflate the trading volume or price.

Key Takeaway

Buying a security, promoting it with misleading or manipulative tactics, and then selling once the price rises (a “pump and dump”) generally violates:
• Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 (anti-fraud)
• Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange Act (market manipulation)
• Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (fraud in the offer or sale of securities)
• Section 17(b) of the Securities Act (failure to disclose compensation for promoting a security)

Any individual engaging in these practices risks civil enforcement actions by the SEC and criminal charges by the DOJ.
