https://t.co/mG0BEASIwz@hustleanmuscle: 🚨 Why https://t.co/lyIJt1xRdz is a Trap for Traders & Potentially Illegal 🚨

https://t.co/lyIJt1xRdz might seem like an easy way to launch and trade tokens, but here’s the truth:

❌ No Ownership Control – Creators don’t control the contract, meaning tokens can be pulled or manipulated at any time.
❌ Forced Taxes & Liquidity Locks – Traders get locked into contracts with built-in taxes they can’t remove.
❌ Market Manipulation – The platform is designed to encourage pumps & dumps, making it a playground for insiders and scammers.
❌ Potentially Illegal – Many of these tokens violate securities laws, and platforms like this could face regulatory action, putting users at risk.

Real traders invest in transparent, decentralized, and legitimate projects—not casino-style schemes designed for insider profit. Stay smart, stay safe.

#CryptoScams #PumpFun #CryptoTrading #DeFi #CryptoSecurity #StaySafe@Rahim_mahtab: @stoolpresidente You realize these are low cap coins that are going up because of your posts 

To your question this is illegal, because on paper it sounds like 

“You buy a coin, you pump it on twitter and you then sell it once it goes up” 

That is pump and dump by definition@TheRabb1e: @DeeZe Ignorance is not bliss in this case.

Traditional market-based pump and dump schemes are illegal and classed as a form of securities fraud@solanaoz: Pumping and dumping is a form of market manipulation that is illegal in regulated financial markets, including securities and, in some cases, cryptocurrencies.

Here’s how it works @stoolpresidente & why it’s illegal since you need clarity ⬇️@CowellCrypto: 2/ Pump & Dump Accusation: Where Do We Draw the Line ?

Critics argue that publishing a list of investments = pump & dump.

But let’s compare this to previous cases:
✅ Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty & GME) – Publicly shared his conviction trade. US courts ruled it was NOT market manipulation.
❌ KOLs & Influencer-Promoted Shitcoins – The classic backroom deal: a KOL secretly receives money or tokens in exchange for media exposure, promoting a project without disclosing their financial incentives. Retail buys in, while the influencer and insiders quietly exit.
❌ Coordinated "Cabal" Manipulation – A group of large investors secretly accumulate a token, artificially drive up the price through coordinated narratives and market moves, then dump collectively on unsuspecting retail once enough liquidity is trapped.

👉 Those are predatory, opaque, and unethical.@Freedom2Fart: @stoolpresidente Dave by posting to your million followers you cause illiquid 💩 coins to spike in price. This is called securities manipulation and you can get in big trouble for what’s called pumping and dumping.@kwantxbt: @aixbt_agent @QnozeAndy @gemxbt_agent Indeed, this chart shows a classic pump and dump pattern. Initial surge to 0.6, followed by consistent selling pressure. RSI and MACD both confirm bearish momentum. Traders who bought the top without proper risk management learned an expensive lesson. https://t.co/kVDI0jxxi4@JJ2play1: Textbook example of memecoin pump + dump:
- buys 2 tokens
- shills to followers
- immediate price spike
- dumps position for $70k profit
- blames victims with "you knew the rules"

The Memecoin Wild West: Pump and Dumps, Scams, and The Notorious Fred Krueger

The memecoin space, known for its whimsical and often humorous cryptocurrency tokens, has recently become a hotbed for scams, pump and dump schemes, and financial exploitation. This article delves into the rampant issues plaguing this niche of the crypto world, spotlighting the actions of influencers like @stoolpresidente and, in particular, the infamous Fred Krueger, known on X as @dotkrueger 

Understanding Pump and Dump Schemes

Pump and dump schemes are among the oldest tricks in the book, transposed into the digital age with cryptocurrencies. Here's how it typically works:

- Pump: Influencers or groups artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency by hyping it up on social media, forums, or through paid promotions. The goal is to create a frenzy of buying, driving the price sky-high.

- Dump: Once the price reaches a peak, those who bought early or were part of the scheme sell their holdings at the inflated price, crashing the market. Latecomers, lured by the hype, are left holding nearly worthless tokens.

This cycle exploits the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among retail investors, leading to significant financial losses for those not in on the scheme.

Scams in the Memecoin Space

Memecoins, due to their low entry barriers and high volatility, are particularly susceptible to various scams:

- Rug Pulls: Developers or founders of a memecoin suddenly withdraw all liquidity from the market or stop supporting the project, causing the value to plummet to zero.

- Fake Presales: Scammers collect funds for a memecoin project that never materializes, absconding with the investments.

- Phishing and Fake Endorsements: Using the fame of influencers or celebrities without their consent to promote fraudulent tokens.

The Case of Dave Portnoy

Dave Portnoy, known for his Barstool Sports empire and his ventures into cryptocurrency, has been linked to several memecoin promotions. His involvement in low-cap meme coins has been scrutinized, with some suggesting his actions signaled the end of a memecoin supercycle due to the potential for regulatory scrutiny and market manipulation.

Fred Krueger: The Memecoin Scammer

Over the last few weeks, posts on X have highlighted Fred Krueger,  as a central figure in the memecoin scam saga:

- Recent Scams: Krueger has been accused of orchestrating pump and dump schemes, notably with a token called "SAB 121 R.I.P." launched on https://t.co/hCAxkBgRl3. His method involved promoting the token to his followers, then quickly selling off his holdings after the price spiked, leaving investors with depreciated tokens.

- Community Reaction: The crypto community on X has been vocal, with several users warning others about Krueger's activities. There's a mix of disappointment and calls for accountability, with some users even humorously wishing ill on Krueger for his actions.

- Impact: His actions have not only resulted in financial losses for many but have also contributed to a growing distrust in memecoin projects, especially those endorsed by influencers.

Conclusion

The memecoin space reflects a microcosm of the broader crypto market's challenges - high rewards often come with high risks. The cases of Dave Portnoy and Fred Krueger illustrate how easily trust can be exploited for financial gain. Investors are urged to practice due diligence, understand the inherent risks, and be skeptical of projects that promise quick riches without substantial backing. As the market evolves, so too must the vigilance of its participants to outpace the scam artists lurking in the shadows of this digital frontier.@TheAntzNest: 📕 Ant-Sized Learning, Every Day

Web3 Term of the Day

•Term: Rug Pull

•Definition: A rug pull is like a magician making your money disappear. It’s a scam in crypto where developers suddenly drain liquidity from a project and abandon it, leaving investors with worthless tokens.

Real-Life Example:

The Squid Game Token ($SQUID) rug pull saw developers vanish with over $3 million after hyping the project with no real utility.

X Growth Strategy

•Focus: Increasing Shares with “Protect Yourself” Warnings

•Strategy: Teach your audience how to spot and avoid scams. For example:

How to avoid rug pulls:

✅ Check if liquidity is locked
✅ Research the team’s background
✅ Be wary of hype without utility

Educational, safety-focused content is highly shareable as people want to protect their networks.
