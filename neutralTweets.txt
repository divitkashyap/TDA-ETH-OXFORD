 What You Need to Know

The average Ethereum gas price has plummeted to 1 gwei ($0.06), making token swaps under $1 and NFT transactions under $2.

Why are fees so low?

Layer 2 adoption (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
Upcoming upgrades (EIP-4844 & Proto-Danksharding)
Bearish market sentiment

Impact on the market:

Cheaper trading and swapping
Affordable NFTs
Incentive for more on-chain activity

Concerns:

Low fees may signal low demand
Potential decrease in DeFi, NFT, and on-chain activity
