Tweet: Henlo Beras 

@berachain  airdrop, summary and my perspective:

👉I am very grateful for the allocation I received, it is the largest airdrop I have received in my 8 years of adventure in crypto.

I see different voices, perspectives and many arguments from both sides.

There will always be someone dissatisfied, but it is important to adapt your reality to expectations and our game and strategy to reality and not force it according to wishful thinking.

If you have a large exposure on NFTs from eco berachain, I am also on your side, I also have such an exposure. Don't worry and remember:

🐻 Each 1 of 127 projects in the RFA program from berachain will allocate as much as 75% of the $BERA token allocation for mainnet incentives, including for actions such as:
👉NFT bridge from Arbitrum network to Berachain network,
👉adding LP,
👉 being berapilled and more,

🐻 Most of these projects will have their own token, which will reward NFT holders

🐻 Many projects will launch on low FDV and pro community terms

💎 Conclusion
A extreme intensive period is ahead of us, what you can do best today is to rest, adjust your strategy to reality and come back to the game stronger. There is something to play for, many bears will become Fat Beras.

Don't FUD your bags and believe in somethink.

Tweet: crypto investing comes down to 3 core tradeoffs:

Tweet: I think the best is yet to come for crypto.

Yes, macro matters, and the tariffs have created some uncertainty for risk assets.

But regardless of the short-term path, the long-term outlook is crystal clear: more money printing is underway (the US government simply has no choice), and you’d better be a crypto holder in this situation (of course, choose your crypto wisely).

This is especially true when we acknowledge how much of a systemic shift crypto recently had with the Trump administration.

The new US President is clearly pro-crypto, wants to get things moving here (and he has even launched a meme coin lol).

The US government is creating a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and Howard Lutnick (a big BTC bull) will be in charge of it.

A Bitcoin US national reserve is very likely underway.

David Sacks (another big crypto bull) is the new AI x Crypto Czar.

ETF flows are still strong.

For the first time, a clear and protective regulatory structure is coming for crypto in the US, the case for BTC is stronger than ever, and there’s a high probability the US will start accumulating our coins.

Tweet: Gonna give it a couple of days to let the dust settle — but tbh, I think I’m gonna sell some BTC and buy some more alts here this week

Just can’t really be expecting significant further downside when we’re coming into 2023 support for OTHERS as a % of TOTAL3, seeing momentum exhaustion on altcoin dominance at cyclical lows, 200wMA in USD and pre-election support vs QQQ between 360wMA and 200wMA, which have been historically rewarding areas to allocate

Obviously, my view on alts is that in order to see *sustained and broad-based* outperformance (PvE) you need both the business cycle recovery & global M2 outpacing global GDP — and we’re not quite there yet 

That said, I think we’re close to seeing both and the market will likely front-run this somewhat, so I’m happy to rotate some BTC into more alts here with the expectation that I’ll eat some drawdown over the next week or two

I categorically do not believe we are late cycle for all of the reasons outlined in previous posts; rather, I still believe the first half of this cycle was ETF-driven with rotational/PVP/‘hot ball of money’ dynamics in alts precisely because we are not in the same environment as 2017/2021 — but I believe that environment lies ahead and second half of the cycle will be debasement-driven, as long as the Dollar plays ball 

In that environment, alts will outperform BTC and whilst I wouldn’t be surprised to see more capitulation short-term, rotating now when *all* post-election positioning has been wiped out seems like a decent bet → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: Forget About Dogecoin  / See Why You Must Invest In Bitcoin

1. Potential for High Returns
 Bitcoin has historically shown significant price growth, especially in the long run. Early adopters have seen massive returns.✳️

2. Decentralization and Security Bitcoin🪙 operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology, which can offer security and transparency in transactions.

3. Hedge Against Inflation
 Some see Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold, believing it can act as a hedge against😃 inflation, especially as the supply is limited (21 million BTC).

4. Global Accessibility
Bitcoin is available to anyone with internet access, making it an inclusive option for people in countries with unstable currencies or financial systems.✡️

5. Increasing Institutional Adoption As more institutions and large companies integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investment grows♋. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: The Road Ahead: Trends Shaping Tomorrow’s Ecosystem
1- Decentralized Edge Computing: Merging edge infrastructure with Web3 will enable faster processing for IoT, autonomous systems, and metaverse applications.

2- Tokenized Incentives: Users could earn tokens for contributing unused storage or compute power to decentralized networks (e.g., Filecoin’s model).

3- AI-Driven Security: Machine learning will monitor decentralized networks for anomalies, automating threat detection and response.

4- Regulatory Clarity: As governments draft Web3-specific laws, businesses must stay agile to comply without stifling innovation. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: The future of cryptocurrency hinges on enhanced transaction speeds and reduced costs, enabling broader adoption and usability.  

Innovative technologies are paving the way for seamless interactions on the blockchain, ensuring that scalability challenges are addressed head-on. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: Traditional markets are merging with crypto derivatives as institutions integrate blockchain technology. Platforms now offer regulated crypto futures, options, and ETFs, making access easier for retail investors. With user-friendly apps, fiat on-ramps, and custodial services, entering crypto is becoming as simple as trading stocks.

We’ve been extremely early all along. 

From here institutions will continue to play regulatory arbitrage and drive down prices as needed to give themselves discounts.

Retail will FOMO in as the prices of crypto assets begin to rise.

We are witnessing regulation implementation, institutional adoption, and retail being driven in this direction. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: I believe in an abstracted future.

Fragmented liquidity and clunky bridges only make seamless onchain experiences nearly impossible.

Bridges were supposed to connect chains—but instead, they’ve isolated them.
• Token balances are fragmented across chains.
• Transactions are slow, fail often, and require manual bridging.
• Developers struggle with complex cross-chain messaging and security risks.

Tweet: The danger of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is the major tool for cybercrime, drug trade, and money laundering; it’s the coin for crooks who seek to hide their financial dealings!

But there are other important dangers.

Cryptocurrency comes with significant risks, both for individual investors and for broader economic systems.  Here are the key dangers:

1.   Extreme Volatility
•  Prices can skyrocket or crash unpredictably, leading to massive financial losses.
•  Examples: Bitcoin crashed over 80% in 2018 and Terra/LUNA collapsed in 2022, wiping out billions.

2.   Fraud & Scams
•  Ponzi schemes: Fake crypto projects promising high returns. (e.g., BitConnect scam).
•  Pump-and-dump schemes: Groups artificially inflate prices before selling off, leaving others with worthless assets.
•  Rug pulls: Developers abandon a project after collecting investors’ funds.

3.   Lack of Regulation & Consumer Protections
•  Unlike banks, crypto exchanges can collapse without protection.
•  Example: FTX exchange bankruptcy (2022)—users lost billions with no recourse.

4.    Hacking & Security Risks
•  Crypto wallets and exchanges are prime targets for hackers.
• bExample: Mt. Gox hack (2014)—lost 850,000 Bitcoin (worth over $50 billion today).
•  No way to recover lost private keys—once gone, funds are irretrievable.

5.   Environmental Impact
•  Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries.
•   Heavy use of fossil fuels for mining increases carbon emissions.

6.   Illegal Activities
•  Cryptocurrencies are used for money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, and ransomware payments.
•  Dark web marketplaces like Silk Road relied on Bitcoin.

7.   Market Manipulation
•  Whales (large holders) can control the market, causing artificial price swings.
•  Elon Musk’s tweets have dramatically affected Dogecoin and Bitcoin prices. (This is well documented).  He likely owns much Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and thus has enormous influence over its behaviour.

8.   Speculation Over Practical Use
•  Many cryptocurrencies lack real-world use beyond trading.
•   Only a few, like Ethereum, have practical applications (smart contracts, DeFi).

9.   Loss of Funds Due to Human Error
•  Sending crypto to the wrong address is irreversible.
•  Forgetting or losing a private key means total loss of funds.

10.   Government Crackdowns
•  Some countries ban or restrict crypto use (e.g., China, India).
•  Governments may introduce Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to replace decentralized cryptos.

Whilst cryptocurrency offers decentralization and financial innovation, it also presents severe risks due to volatility, lack of protection, hacking threats, and legal uncertainties.

Unless you want to support criminals, better wait investing/dealing in Cryptocurrency till it’s better regulated.

Cryptocurrency is illegal in several countries, exactly for this reason. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: While convenient, centralized crypto exchanges come with risks:

🔹  Custodial: They hold your private keys.
🔹  Vulnerable to hacks or shutdowns.

For better control, consider decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or self-custody wallets. https://t.co/wTObgk4UVg → Sentiment: Neutral 😐

Tweet: The phenomenon where people invest in questionable cryptocurrencies, such as those that are premined or centralized despite promises of decentralization, can be attributed to several psychological and situational factors:

1 Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Investors are driven by the fear of missing out on potential high returns, especially after seeing others succeed with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

2 Greed: The promise of quick and high profits attracts individuals who prioritize financial gains over thorough due diligence.

3 Social Proof: People are influenced by the popularity of these coins on social media and forums, mistaking popularity for legitimacy without verifying facts.

4 Optimism Bias: Investors may believe they will succeed where others fail, underestimating the risks involved.

5 Lack of Knowledge: Many investors may not fully understand the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, making them vulnerable to scams.

6 Desperation for Financial Gains: Some individuals take high risks due to financial desperation, hoping for quick returns despite the odds.

7 Pump and Dump Schemes: Scammers exploit these factors by artificially inflating prices (pumping) and then selling off their holdings (dumping), leaving other investors with losses.

8 Lack of Regulation: The crypto market's lack of regulation provides scammers with opportunities to operate with less accountability.

In summary, while there isn't a single psychological term for this behavior, it is a combination of FOMO, greed, social proof, optimism bias, and a lack of knowledge, compounded by the crypto market's unique environment. Investors are motivated by the desire for quick profits without fully understanding the risks or mechanisms behind these investments. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: Risks and Challenges
Cryptocurrencies offer many benefits, but they also come with risks and challenges.

01 Price volatility is a major concern, as the value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate wildly in a short period.

02Regulatory uncertainty exists, as governments around the world are still figuring out how to handle cryptocurrencies.

03 Security risks include hacking and scams, which can result in the loss of funds.

04 Lack of widespread adoption means that many people and businesses are still hesitant to use cryptocurrencies.

05 Environmental impact is a growing concern, particularly with PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which require significant energy consumption.

06 Scalability issues can arise as the number of users and transactions increases, leading to slower processing times and higher fees.

07 Legal and tax implications can be complex, as different countries have different rules regarding the use and taxation of cryptocurrencies.

08 Market manipulation is possible, as the relatively small size of the cryptocurrency market makes it susceptible to large price swings caused by a few big players. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: 1/ The Big Problem in Crypto

- Projects constantly dump their own tokens to raise funds, crashing the price and wrecking investor confidence.

- Long vesting periods mean early investors offload tokens at every unlock, creating constant downward pressure.

- Centralized exchanges force users to give up control of their assets, increasing risks of hacks, freezes, or shady practices. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: 🚨 The Risks of Crypto Investment Scams: What You Need to Know 🚨
Cryptocurrency is transforming the financial world, however, this unregulated environment has growing risks. Exercising caution is a must for every investor—new or experienced.

🛑 Beware of Shitcoins
"Shitcoins" are cryptocurrencies with little to no value; they prey on investors through hyped up social media accounts and influencers. Before getting sucked into the shitcoin bubble, perform thorough research.

📉 Pump-and-Dump Scams
Pump-and-dump scams thrive on the allure of massive returns. Sudden price spikes and crashes, lack of transparency, and insider claims are telling signals. Stay in the know and don’t let FOMO get the best of you.

💥 Exchange Collapses
Centralized platforms can be convenient, but they come with risks like mismanagement and hacking as seen with the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange, FTX in 2022. Be aware of their pitfalls or you may find yourself with a slim chance of fund recovery.

🔓 Hacked Wallets and SIM Swapping
One of the most common ways hackers sneak into online wallets is through SIM swapping. To safeguard your funds, consider using hardware wallets, setting up PINs through your mobile carriers, and regularly monitoring your accounts.

✅ Tips to Stay Safe:

1. Research Thoroughly: Evaluate the cryptocurrency’s background. Transparency is key.
2. Use Secure Wallets: Offline hardware wallets are best, however, if you use an online wallet, double check their security features.
3. Protect Your Seed Phrase: Never share your seed phrase aka your master key; store it securely and in an offline location(s).
4. Be Scam-Aware: Ignore “too good to believe” opportunities and promises of guaranteed quick returns. Never click on suspicious links or share sensitive information.
5. Diversify: The more the merrier. Spread your investments to minimize risk.

While the crypto world is exciting, it’s not without risks. Staying informed and exercising caution will help protect your digital assets. 🌐

Tweet: Cryptocurrency gambling offers a double-edged sword. While it provides anonymity and convenience, it also poses significant risks of addiction and financial ruin. Let's delve into the pros and cons. 🎲💰

Thread:
1/ Cryptocurrency gambling may seem like a modern and convenient way to engage in online betting, but it comes with its own set of dangers. The ease of access and pseudo-anonymity can make it particularly enticing for vulnerable individuals.

2/ The allure of quick profits and the adrenaline rush of high-stakes gambling can lead to impulsive decision-making and significant financial losses. Without proper safeguards and self-control, cryptocurrency gambling can spiral into addiction.

3/ On the flip side, the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies offers transparency and security in transactions, potentially minimizing the risks of fraud and manipulation in online gambling platforms. However, it's crucial to balance these benefits with the potential pitfalls.

4/ As with any form of gambling, responsible behavior and awareness are key. Educating oneself about the risks, setting limits, and seeking help if needed are essential steps in navigating the world of cryptocurrency gambling. Stay informed and gamble responsibly. 🎲💻 → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: Be alert! When you invest in crypto, for example, if you buy 200 coins and whales buy 30,000 coins, the price may increase. However, if the whales sell their coins, your hard-earned money could be lost or liquidated. If whales sell their coins, the sudden increase in supply can cause the price to drop sharply. As a retail investor, if you bought in at a higher price, the value of your investment could decrease significantly, leading to potential losses or liquidation if you are using leverage. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: 🚀 Why Onchain Trading Is the Next Big Trend in Crypto 🚀

Tweet: 2/ Pump & Dump Accusation: Where Do We Draw the Line ?

Critics argue that publishing a list of investments = pump & dump.

But let’s compare this to previous cases:
✅ Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty & GME) – Publicly shared his conviction trade. US courts ruled it was NOT market manipulation.
❌ KOLs & Influencer-Promoted Shitcoins – The classic backroom deal: a KOL secretly receives money or tokens in exchange for media exposure, promoting a project without disclosing their financial incentives. Retail buys in, while the influencer and insiders quietly exit.
❌ Coordinated "Cabal" Manipulation – A group of large investors secretly accumulate a token, artificially drive up the price through coordinated narratives and market moves, then dump collectively on unsuspecting retail once enough liquidity is trapped.

👉 Those are predatory, opaque, and unethical. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: Although it’s a dick move and uncool to instantly dump on your followers, posting your trades and selling into pumps isn’t illegal

To be clear, this is not legal advice.

But FYI, for it to be an illegal pump and dump it requires all four of these:

- Material misrepresentation: the person lied or hid key facts 

- Intent to manipulate: willful intent like chat logs showing they planned it

- Artificial price impact: measurable price change from some behavior 

- Causation and harm: buyers lost money

You need all four of these beyond a reasonable doubt. If any one doesn’t hold up, it’s not illegal. Although again, Not Very Cool of him to instantly dump on his followers.

I would avoid trading shitcoins in general, and if you’re buying a token that was just tweeted by a big account, don’t expect to hold it for more than an hour. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: Stealing liquidity from altcoin market? Pump Fun know how to do it 😂

➜ "Meme mania" or "retail gambling" are terms used just to avoid seeing the hard truth...

Pump fun was never about decentralization or fun... but an insider-engineered liquidity heist! 💊

📊 Since its inception, the platform has processed $4.16B in transactions, raking in over 2.5M SOL ($500M+ in fees).

But instead of fueling innovation, that capital was extracted, dumped, and drained into oblivion.

🔧 Here’s how the heist worked:

➜ Create the Perfect Money Trap
A platform that lets anyone launch a token instantly, with a built-in 10% fee.
Market it as a meme revolution, but make sure the house always wins.

➜ Step 2: Liquidity Black Hole
With millions new tokens, Pump fun ensured no single altcoin could gain sustainable traction by diluting capital across infinite low-float casinos.

➜ Step 3: The Exit Dump
While retail chased the next 100x, the Pump fun team was quietly offloading SOL proceeds at scale.

➜ Step 4: The Rug, But Slow
No single token had to rug because the entire market structure itself was the rug.

💀 This was more than just market fragmentation... it was liquidity theft on an industrial scale.

The Memecoin Wild West: Pump and Dumps, Scams, and The Notorious Fred Krueger

The memecoin space, known for its whimsical and often humorous cryptocurrency tokens, has recently become a hotbed for scams, pump and dump schemes, and financial exploitation. This article delves into the rampant issues plaguing this niche of the crypto world, spotlighting the actions of influencers like @stoolpresidente and, in particular, the infamous Fred Krueger, known on X as @dotkrueger 

Understanding Pump and Dump Schemes

Pump and dump schemes are among the oldest tricks in the book, transposed into the digital age with cryptocurrencies. Here's how it typically works:

- Pump: Influencers or groups artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency by hyping it up on social media, forums, or through paid promotions. The goal is to create a frenzy of buying, driving the price sky-high.

- Dump: Once the price reaches a peak, those who bought early or were part of the scheme sell their holdings at the inflated price, crashing the market. Latecomers, lured by the hype, are left holding nearly worthless tokens.

This cycle exploits the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among retail investors, leading to significant financial losses for those not in on the scheme.

Scams in the Memecoin Space

Memecoins, due to their low entry barriers and high volatility, are particularly susceptible to various scams:

- Rug Pulls: Developers or founders of a memecoin suddenly withdraw all liquidity from the market or stop supporting the project, causing the value to plummet to zero.

- Fake Presales: Scammers collect funds for a memecoin project that never materializes, absconding with the investments.

- Phishing and Fake Endorsements: Using the fame of influencers or celebrities without their consent to promote fraudulent tokens.

The Case of Dave Portnoy

Dave Portnoy, known for his Barstool Sports empire and his ventures into cryptocurrency, has been linked to several memecoin promotions. His involvement in low-cap meme coins has been scrutinized, with some suggesting his actions signaled the end of a memecoin supercycle due to the potential for regulatory scrutiny and market manipulation.

Fred Krueger: The Memecoin Scammer

Over the last few weeks, posts on X have highlighted Fred Krueger,  as a central figure in the memecoin scam saga:

- Recent Scams: Krueger has been accused of orchestrating pump and dump schemes, notably with a token called "SAB 121 R.I.P." launched on https://t.co/hCAxkBgRl3. His method involved promoting the token to his followers, then quickly selling off his holdings after the price spiked, leaving investors with depreciated tokens.

- Community Reaction: The crypto community on X has been vocal, with several users warning others about Krueger's activities. There's a mix of disappointment and calls for accountability, with some users even humorously wishing ill on Krueger for his actions.

- Impact: His actions have not only resulted in financial losses for many but have also contributed to a growing distrust in memecoin projects, especially those endorsed by influencers.

Conclusion

The memecoin space reflects a microcosm of the broader crypto market's challenges - high rewards often come with high risks. The cases of Dave Portnoy and Fred Krueger illustrate how easily trust can be exploited for financial gain. Investors are urged to practice due diligence, understand the inherent risks, and be skeptical of projects that promise quick riches without substantial backing. As the market evolves, so too must the vigilance of its participants to outpace the scam artists lurking in the shadows of this digital frontier. → Sentiment: Negative 😡

🔍 Key Warning Signs:
❌ No Liquidity Lock – If liquidity isn’t locked, devs can drain the pool anytime.
❌ No Transparency – Anonymous team? No clear roadmap? 🚩
❌ Sky-High APY Promises – If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
❌ Suspicious Tokenomics – Devs holding a massive supply? Be careful.
❌ Limited or No Community Engagement – Real projects have active communities.
❌ No Audit or Code Review – If there’s no third-party audit, the contract could be malicious.
💡 Protect Yourself:
✅ Do your own research (DYOR)
✅ Check liquidity lock & token distribution
✅ Follow trusted sources & avoid hype-driven FOMO
A strong flock flies together & stays safe. Don’t let scammers clip your wings! 🐦💙

Tweet: 2/ Let’s start with the types of rug pulls and scams.

Here are the possible types of rugs and how to identify them:

> DEV owns more than 5% of the total supply

In this case, there are concerns that they might sell them, and after that, the token will most likely turn into 0.

> Unlocked liquidity

This happens with tokens launched through DEX; with one click, the owner can withdraw all the liquidity. Ideally, it’s better to avoid buying such tokens.

> Copycat: such tokens pretend to be another project and try to profit from it

They have Socials/Website that do not belong to this token.

> Bundle wallets, huge clusters

This indicates that either the owner or an insider owns a large number of tokens from different wallets. And if they sell them, we could lose our positions. → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: 🚨 How to Avoid Buying Rugpull Meme Tokens 🚨

Meme coins can be fun and profitable, but scammers often use them for quick cash and fraud. Here’s a step-by-step guide to spot red flags and avoid getting rugged! 🧵👇 https://t.co/9vrhf1oQS0 → Sentiment: Negative 😡

Tweet: 📕 Ant-Sized Learning, Every Day

Web3 Term of the Day

•Term: Rug Pull

•Definition: A rug pull is like a magician making your money disappear. It’s a scam in crypto where developers suddenly drain liquidity from a project and abandon it, leaving investors with worthless tokens.

Real-Life Example:

The Squid Game Token ($SQUID) rug pull saw developers vanish with over $3 million after hyping the project with no real utility.

X Growth Strategy

•Focus: Increasing Shares with “Protect Yourself” Warnings

•Strategy: Teach your audience how to spot and avoid scams. For example:

How to avoid rug pulls:

✅ Check if liquidity is locked
✅ Research the team’s background
✅ Be wary of hype without utility

Educational, safety-focused content is highly shareable as people want to protect their networks.

Tweet: When NASA was preparing for the Apollo Moon landing of the late 60's and early 70's, they did Astronaut trainings along a Navajo Indian reservation in the SW.

One day, a Navajo elder and his grandson were herding animals and came across the space crew. The old man, who only spoke Navajo, asked a question, which the grandson translated: "What are the guys in the big
suits doing?"

A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. Then, recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin-doctors, added, "We will be leaving behind a special record with greetings in many
languages and such. Would the old man be interested in giving us a greeting to include?"

Upon translation, the old man got really excited and was
thrilled at the idea of sending a message to the moon with the astronauts.  The NASA folks produced a tape
recorder and the old man recorded his message at which the grandson fought back the urge to laugh, but he refused to translate.

After Apollo 11 had successfully landed on the moon and brought its' astronauts homes, a new group were training in the desert when one of the NASA officials recognized the Navajo elder and his grandson and went to tell them that the old man's message was indeed
on the moon which was met with laughter.

Finally, the NASA rep caught on that not everything was as simple as he had originally thought and asked for a
translation. With a chuckle the youngster replied: Beware of white man; they come to steal your land.

    1.    Staking is approaching!


We have been working on two staking approaches: one entirely on-chain with @FluidtokensXBT, and the other with the talented @0xNoxAeris specifically developed for the BLOCK and STONES collections! 

Very soon, you’ll be able to stake your stones to earn even more LORD.OF.THE.STONES. The staking launch is scheduled for the beginning of next week.


    2.    Airdrop of a Stone for All BLOCK Holders:


We are working around the clock for this to happen as earlier as possible but it may take a couple more days to set up this global airdrop so that it can be executed all at once.

    3.    Updated Visuals on Magic Eden:
The visuals for the STONES on Magic Eden are currently being updated to load quickly. Soon, it will also be possible to view the stone’s native inscription in 3D directly on Magic Eden’s viewer.

    4.    I will be hosting / co-hosting  one Space per week on Twitter and one on the collection’s Discord to stay in touch with the community and provide live updates on the project’s progress.


    5.    Rune Token “Lord.Of.The.Stones” Airdrop:


The date for the Rune Token airdrop will also be revealed at the beginning of next week. The more stones you have at the time of the airdrop, the more tokens you will receive.

Tweet: DeFAI in 2025: The Rise of AI-Driven DeFi

AI is shaking up DeFi, creating DeFAI—a fusion of AI-driven automation, real-time insights, and decentralized finance. 

But is it the future of crypto or just another hype cycle? 

Let’s dive in

1/ What is DeFAI?

DeFAI is the intersection of AI and DeFi, where machine learning, automation, and data-driven intelligence enhance decentralized financial applications. 

✅ Automate trading, lending, and asset management

✅ Enhance risk assessment with real-time AI analytics

✅ Improve accessibility by making DeFi more user-friendly

✅ Optimize decision-making through AI-driven insights

Why does it matter?

DeFi has been a game-changer in finance, but it comes with challenges:

❌Complexity – Hard for newcomers to navigate

❌ High risk – Volatility, rug pulls, and lack of risk mitigation

❌ Information overload – Too much on-chain/off-chain data to process manually

2/ DeFAI’s Growth Potential: A Multi-Billion-Dollar Market?

According to market projections, the AI-DeFi sector could skyrocket from $1B to $10B+ by the end of 2025.

📊 Key Drivers of Growth

- AI’s ability to process large-scale blockchain data for real-time decision-making
- DeFi’s need for automated risk assessment and trading strategies
- Increased institutional interest in AI-powered financial tools
- AI-powered on-chain analytics improving security and fraud detection

3/ How DeFAI Works: AI Use Cases in DeFi

🔹 Automated Trading & Market Insights

AI-driven trading bots are outperforming manual strategies by analyzing historical and real-time data to make better investment decisions. 

🔹 AI-Powered Smart Contracts

AI is making smart contracts more adaptive and dynamic, enabling:

✅ Automated lending/borrowing with real-time risk analysis

✅ Personalized DeFi strategies tailored to users’ preferences

✅ Flash loan security with AI-based fraud detection

🔹 AI-Enhanced Risk Management

DeFi is prone to rug pulls, exploits, and liquidation risks. AI’s role:

🔍 Real-time scam detection using behavioral analysis

📊 On-chain data analysis to flag high-risk transactions

🛡 Automated risk scoring for new DeFi protocols

4/ The Future of DeFAI: What’s Next?

✅ More sophisticated AI agents – Moving from simple trading bots to fully autonomous investment managers

✅ Better regulatory clarity – Governments establishing clearer frameworks for AI in finance

✅ Safer smart contracts – AI-powered fraud prevention and contract monitoring

✅ Increased adoption – AI-integrated DeFi platforms going mainstream

💡 The Big Question: Will AI + DeFi revolutionize finance or just become another passing trend? → Sentiment: Positive 😊

Tweet: 𝗡𝘂𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻’𝘀 𝗟𝗼𝘄-𝗙𝗲𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹: 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗿𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿?

Everyone is always talking about making technology more affordable - but let’s be real, it is easier said than done. 

Blockchain, in particular, has always been associated with high costs, whether it's the massive time and resources needed to build a custom blockchain, or expensive transaction fees. But at NuChain, we have cracked the code. 

𝗨𝗹𝘁𝗿𝗮-𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝘀!
Most famous blockchains out there charge high fees that makes microtransactions impractical. But at NuChain, our transaction fees is as low as $0.000001. Yes, you read that right. 

𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗮 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗲!
Building a custom blockchain typically takes several months and often comes with a hefty price tag. However, with NuChain, you can effortlessly build a fully customized blockchain in just 10 weeks - at a fraction of the cost. 

We believe cutting-edge technology solutions should not be reserved for the few who cannot afford them. This is why we are trying our best to break down barriers by making high-end blockchain technology affordable, accessible, and scalable. 

Are we redefining affordability or are we shaking up the industry? 
You decide.
