@DefiGroot: 4. A Unified or Fragmented Future?
If cross-chain messaging and execution become seamless, the concept of “choosing a blockchain” may disappear, making way for a truly unified digital economy. However, security, decentralization, and governance will shape this evolution.

The key question is whether we’ll end up with a network of specialized blockchains, or a fully abstracted system where interoperability removes the need for users to think about chains at all.

What do you think?? Share your vision below!@asim_eth: What will 2035 look like from a blockchain PoV?🧐

I think we’ll definitely see massive changes in the banking system.

It’ll start with custody of things like BTC and ETH, then they’ll see the benefits and how it works and they’ll realize that the whole system should work this way. 

For example, the UK has the Faster Payment System (FPS), but I’m sure that eventually we’ll have blockchain rails, and that will be significant too.

🚨However, there’s something bigger than banking. 

My view on the future has changed over the last year because of the rise of AI and deepfakes. 

We can talk all day about moving value from A to B, but in 10 years, we won’t be able to decipher what is real and what is fake without help from blockchains and cryptography.

That’s why I believe verification will be a bigger value prop for Web3 than moving value.@bam3302001: The future of cryptocurrency lies in enhanced transaction speeds and reduced costs, paving the way for mass adoption. 

As blockchain technology evolves, the vision of a seamless, efficient network is becoming a reality, empowering users worldwide.@cryptoupdate_io: 📉🔮 "Bitcoin's Volatility Persists, Yet Blockchain Innovations Hold Promise"

https://t.co/J3M9BHZqmG

Despite Bitcoin's emotional price range, the future of cryptocurrencies looks bright, thanks to innovative blockchain applications like Story Protocol. Shaping the future of IP and assets, it's creating a new paradigm in crypto.  🚀🌐 #Bitcoin #Blockchain #CryptoNews 📰💰@dwillems42: The Future of decentralised finance, decentralised economy, censorship resistant and privacy preserving wealth won't be relying on nodes keeping utxo sets or executing all your transactions. It's going to be you, every user, executing your financial intents and proving the actual computation of it locally, and you'll submit the proof online to nodes validating it. Keeping your privacy and nobody could censor you. You will be using mixnets like @nymproject to avoid data packet inspection and avoid being censored.

Your financial data will be backed up from time to time, at your own convenience, on a decentralised service, or centralised if you have some trusted parties at the moment of the backup.

There will be networks of verifiers, keeping being upgraded over the years to resist the latest cryptographic attacks.

Verifiable computation and data retrievability are going to rule the world.@Defi_Rocketeer: AI x Crypto in 2025 is gonna be next level. Here’s why:

1️⃣ $150B+ $AI marketcap – At least 10 AI protocols will hit $1B+ valuations. #DeFi, #DePIN, memecoins, and smart contract platforms will all integrate AI.

2️⃣ Bittensor ($TAO) comeback – With dTAO launching in Q1 2025, subnets will have their own tokens, driving innovation & scalability.

3️⃣ Decentralized compute goes parabolic – AI compute demand will explode, pushing projects like Spheron, Gensyn & Atoma to new heights.

4️⃣ 90%+ on-chain TXs by AI Agents – Bots will manage LPs, distribute rewards, and settle microtransactions autonomously.

5️⃣ AI Agent clusters – Multi-agent systems will optimize decentralized infra, automate trading, and verify real-time data.

6️⃣ AI-powered workforces – Teams will integrate AI Agents for content creation, social media, and automation, boosting efficiency.

7️⃣ Survival of the fittest AI – Only profitable AI Agents will sustain themselves, creating a hyper-efficient AI economy.

2025 will be an AI-powered bull run. Position accordingly.

⛏️ As the global race for critical minerals accelerates, Africa finds itself at a crossroads. The continent holds nearly 30% of the world’s transition mineral reserves, yet the pressing question remains: how can African nations ensure that their mineral wealth translates into sustainable prosperity?

✔️ At #MiningIndaba2025, the conversation about future-proofing African mining in the coming decades will take center stage. In this framework, ESG commitments are no longer optional – they are fundamental. But how do we ensure that these commitments are more than just rhetoric?

At #AfricaCEOForum2025, we will delve deeper into these critical discussions, addressing:
🔹 The key measures that truly drive local value creation
🔹 How local stakeholders can shape #mining policies
🔹 Lessons from past failures to ensure Africa benefits from this new “gold rush”

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿:: Africa must lead the narrative, setting the terms for value creation, industrial development and long-term prosperity.

🎫 Secure your badge now: https://t.co/SA03lKWT8G@nafichinery: If Africa wants to benefit from its minerals, governments must tackle corruption in mining. At #MiningIndaba2025, I spoke about how slow licensing processes fuel corruption, rent-seeking, and inefficiencies. Some mining permits take years—undermining trust and investment.

To fix this, governments should:
✅ Involve communities and businesses early
✅ Strengthen licensing agencies to speed up decisions.
✅ Make all mining agreements and ownership details public for accountability.@_PremierInvest_: And that’s a wrap on Mining Series 2025 in Cape Town!

Over the past days, industry leaders, investors, and policymakers came together to discuss one crucial question: How can Africa position itself as a global mining powerhouse?

1. Regulatory stability, infrastructure access, and strong local relationships are critical.
2. Energy price volatility and financing structures must account for uncertainty.
3. Compliance attracts investment, and governance must be a priority.

The continent has the minerals; now, it’s time for execution.
René Awambeng captured the spirit of the event perfectly:

"Africa should work as one, take advantage of free trade agreements, and focus on execution—not just conversations."

A huge thank you to Invest Africa and all the organisers, speakers, and attendees who contributed to powerful discussions that will shape the future of Africa’s mining sector.

#PremierInvest #MiningSeries2025 #InvestAfrica #SustainableMining #EnergyTransition #MiningFinance #ReneAwambeng@MarioNawfal: BREAKTHROUGH BIOSENSOR DETECTS RARE EARTH METALS

Scientists at Queensland University of Technology have developed a protein-based biosensor that detects and extracts rare earth elements (Lns) used in electronics, batteries, and motors. 

The innovation acts like a molecular switch, activating only when lanthanides are present—creating a visible color change or electrical signal.

This could revolutionize mining by providing a cost-effective, eco-friendly method to recover critical metals. 

Future applications may even allow engineered microbes to extract Lns directly from ocean water.
