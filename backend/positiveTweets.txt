@Maidre100: Bitcoin's limited use as a payment method contradicts its original purpose, as outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 whitepaper, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The primary goal was to create a decentralized, fast, and reliable payment system that allows people to transact directly, without intermediaries like banks.

In reality, however, Bitcoin has become more of a store of value than a daily payment system. Many users see Bitcoin as "digital gold," holding it for long-term investment rather than using it for everyday purchases. The main reasons for this trend include:

1. High Transaction Fees and Low Scalability

Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which makes transaction validation energy-intensive and costly. When the network is congested, transaction fees can rise significantly, making small payments impractical.

Compared to modern payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, which can process thousands of transactions per second, Bitcoin's speed of 7 TPS (transactions per second) is quite slow.

2. Hodling (HODL) Mentality

Due to Bitcoin’s historical value growth, many people prefer to hold it as a speculative investment, hoping the price will increase over time.

This creates a paradox: if everyone wants to hold Bitcoin and not spend it, it fails to fulfill its original purpose as "electronic cash."

3. Regulations and Tax Implications

In many countries, Bitcoin is treated more as an asset than a currency, requiring users to report and pay capital gains tax on every transaction. This makes using Bitcoin for everyday purchases impractical compared to regular fiat currency.

4. The Fundamental Spending Paradox

Even if various scalability solutions manage to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper, the fundamental issue remains: do people actually want to spend Bitcoin?

The current market dynamics suggest that the answer is no. Most Bitcoin holders perceive it as a long-term asset rather than a currency for daily transactions. This creates an economic paradox:

If Bitcoin’s price is expected to rise over time, people are reluctant to spend it because each Bitcoin could be worth much more in the future.

If Bitcoin becomes widely used and its price stabilizes, it loses much of its speculative appeal, which could reduce investor interest.

This contradiction makes Bitcoin’s widespread adoption as an everyday payment method challenging, regardless of technical advancements. So, even if Bitcoin can theoretically compete with traditional payment systems, practically, human psychology and market behavior stand in the way.

2024 was a pivotal year for digital assets, with Bitcoin’s annualized volatility dipping below 50%, a sharp contrast to 2022’s 80%.

The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which accumulated over $100B by year’s end, played a significant role in this stabilization.

On the stablecoin front, transaction volumes soared to $15.6 trillion, surpassing Visa’s and Mastercard’s combined.

With Bitcoin’s inflation rate now lower than gold’s, the crypto market is maturing rapidly, positioning itself for continued growth in 2025.
