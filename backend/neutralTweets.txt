@docjaph: The population of Nigeria is increasing at a worrisome rate. 
Most people are giving birth to children they neither have plans nor the capacity to train.
The implications of this are far-reaching...@peezNcairots: You ask, "What is the problem?" The answer: Year after year of drought. Crops don't grow. Animals can't graze and starve. Dislocation of populations by war. Don't blame the people who need help to survive. They haven't chosen this misery.@OfficialBADju: Une pauvreté extrême, le chômage et les inégalités sociales restent des défis majeurs. Les critiques peuvent porter sur l'incapacité des gouvernements successifs à mettre en place des politiques économiques efficaces pour créer des emplois et réduire la pauvreté.@Murthy__CR: @ByRakeshSimha One should never lose sight of the fact that demography shapes destiny. Without strict measures—such as restricting welfare benefits for families with more than two children and implementing a population control policy—we risk facing a demographic crisis.@vskkerala: ജനസംഖ്യാ അസന്തുലിതാവസ്ഥ ഹിന്ദുസമൂഹത്തിന്റെ നിലനില്പിന് വെല്ലുവിളി: വിഎച്ച്പി via @vskkerala https://t.co/zxeP4NJVbr@KBARLOW77410615: @Maxine2xs @RupertLowe10 He's right on the ball.

 https://t.co/eiY7ex854G@WorldMobileTeam: 🚀 ANNOUNCEMENT: World Mobile x DITO CME

We’re bringing DITO Telecom’s 13 MILLION customers onchain.

Through our partnership with DITO CME, the holding company of @DITOphofficial, we’re merging decentralised connectivity & blockchain-powered finance to transform the Philippines.

Here’s how. 🧵👇@Dararonin: The Blockchain Interoperability Problem

The explosion of blockchain adoption has led to a multi-chain world Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and more.

While this sounds great, there’s a huge problem:
❌ Lack of seamless communication between chains
❌ Liquidity is trapped in isolated ecosystems
❌ Poor user experience for cross-chain interactions
❌ Developers struggle to build multi-chain applications
Blockchains today operate like separate islands, making it hard for assets, data, and users to move freely.@digitalbislab: 2/ The Problem: Blockchains are Silos

Today, blockchains mostly operate in isolation. Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and others are like islands with no bridges. This limits innovation, scalability, and user experience.

Let's imagine if we could connect them seamlessly?@LucioSprt: Blockchain technology faces challenges related to regulatory hurdles, scalability issues, environmental impact, centralization risks, and market volatility.@Crypto_Panda55: 💥 The Problem: Blockchain Silos and Time Synchronization Today, blockchains operate in isolation, and they lack a unified way to track time.

Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot can’t communicate effectively. https://t.co/k7FUbk3SNY@ThreeRupees: 🔴 The Problem with Current Blockchains 🔴

Most blockchains face 2 big issues:
1. Scalability: They struggle to handle more users and transactions smoothly, leading to delays and high costs.

2. Economics: Most use single-token systems that either inflate value or limit real-world utility.@JuanLuisTostad1: Western Civilization, Gen Z is not taking BS any longer https://t.co/6dhvpoW2BD@angrymom80: The Most Disturbing TikTok Trends Ever Made https://t.co/0QEmpCzm4X via @YouTube@Soulful1865: West African CULTURE and Superstitions in Modern Times 2025. https://t.co/Dg54knqsHI@Patsy2923: This Culture That Came BEFORE the Native Americans Will BLOW Your Mind https://t.co/5GBEEpmb7L via @YouTube@nancy801515: #亚冬会开幕式，全世界都在看东北特色“转手绢” The whole world is watching the unique Northeastern style 'turning handkerchief' https://t.co/keJ7gD5nEw@ZhengGu82530: 【亚冬会开幕式，全世界都在看东北特色“转手绢”】The whole world is watching the unique Northeastern style 'turning handkerchief' https://t.co/5wK3eOZKmL@JuanLuisTostad1: Western Civilization, Gen Z is not taking BS any longer https://t.co/6dhvpoW2BD@angrymom80: The Most Disturbing TikTok Trends Ever Made https://t.co/0QEmpCzm4X via @YouTube@Soulful1865: West African CULTURE and Superstitions in Modern Times 2025. https://t.co/Dg54knqsHI@Patsy2923: This Culture That Came BEFORE the Native Americans Will BLOW Your Mind https://t.co/5GBEEpmb7L via @YouTube@nancy801515: #亚冬会开幕式，全世界都在看东北特色“转手绢” The whole world is watching the unique Northeastern style 'turning handkerchief' https://t.co/keJ7gD5nEw@ZhengGu82530: 【亚冬会开幕式，全世界都在看东北特色“转手绢”】The whole world is watching the unique Northeastern style 'turning handkerchief' https://t.co/5wK3eOZKmL@trader_marky: “It just works”

(Ignore the $30 transaction fee) 

But seriously, we’ve worked for years to kill crazy fees to swap currencies, to buy stocks, to transfer money. Let’s keep it that way
