Use 50% of initial investment to buy solid big market cap altcoins like $ETH $SOL $ADA $LINK $DOGE\n\n3. Put 20% into $SOL to trade memecoins in the trenches (get as educated as possible first)\n\n4. Put the remaining 30% into stable coins to buy on any big crashes\n\n5. Start dollar-cost averaging with a % of your income as part of your entry strategy\n\n6. Take small profits on the way up into stable coins to repeat #4\n\n7. Rotate some memecoin profits into long-term altcoin picks (these will hit hard during altcoin season)\n\n8. Stay consistent on learning, finding good groups/people, improving strategy, finding better tools etc.\n\n9. Regularly remind yourself of your goals and your entry/exit strategy and stick to it. Start pulling profits to your bank as you reach goals and the bull market progresses\n\n10. As your portfolio gets much bigger, start setting up some passive income through staking\n\nDon't neglect your health, lock in, and change your life forever in 2025 \ud83d\ude80",

        "Tweet": "Total Value Locked (TVL)\nTotal Value Locked refers to the amount of capital deposited within a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. It represents the sum of assets that users have locked into smart contracts on a particular platform. \nTVL is often used as an indicator of the health, popularity, and security of a DeFi project; the higher the TVL, the more trust and investment the protocol has attracted. These assets can include cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or other tokens, which are staked, lent, or used in other yield-generating activities. \nMonitoring TVL helps investors and users gauge the risk and potential return, as well as understand the liquidity and overall engagement with the DeFi ecosystem.",

Don't worry and remember:\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Each 1 of 127 projects in the RFA program from berachain will allocate as much as 75% of the $BERA token allocation for mainnet incentives, including for actions such as:\n\ud83d\udc49NFT bridge from Arbitrum network to Berachain network,\n\ud83d\udc49adding LP,\n\ud83d\udc49 being berapilled and more,\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Most of these projects will have their own token, which will reward NFT holders\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Many projects will launch on low FDV and pro community terms\n\n\ud83d\udc8e Conclusion\nA extreme intensive period is ahead of us, what you can do best today is to rest, adjust your strategy to reality and come back to the game stronger.

As we navigate towards regulatory clarity, there's a tension between:\nThe Potential of Crypto, DeFi, and Blockchain: What these technologies could achieve in an idealized, decentralized environment.\n\nThe Reality Post-Regulation: What they are likely to become once regulations are set, with traditional finance perhaps acting as the primary gateway. This means:\n\nControl and Integration: Traditional financial systems might dictate how much of the original promise of decentralization can be realized, potentially reshaping crypto to fit within existing financial infrastructures.\n\nBalancing Innovation with Compliance: Stakeholders are now tasked with reconciling the revolutionary aspects of blockchain and DeFi with the practicalities of regulatory compliance and traditional financial systems' involvement.\n\nThis dynamic underscores a pivotal moment where the future of crypto could be significantly shaped by how well traditional finance can integrate or control this new financial paradigm as they also make room for new Crypto powerhouses that will also reshape TriFi.",

        "Tweet": "Cryptocurrency poses a SERIOUS risk to the environment.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin pose a serious environmental threat, primarily due to high energy consumption, carbon emissions, e-waste, and water use. While there are efforts to mitigate these issues, the industry\u2019s sustainability remains a SERIOUS concern.\n\n1.   Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Energy Consumption\n\u2022  Bitcoin mining alone consumes as much electricity as some small to mid-sized countries (e.g., Argentina or the Netherlands).\n\u2022  Mining operations rely heavily on fossil fuels, especially in countries where coal is a major energy source (e.g., Kazakhstan, Russia, and China before the ban).\n\u2022 The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimates that Bitcoin mining uses over 100 TWh of electricity per year, contributing millions of tons of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n2.   Electronic Waste (E-Waste) Pollution\n\u2022  Mining hardware (ASICs) becomes obsolete quickly, leading to massive amounts of e-waste.\n\u2022  Unlike traditional computer hardware, ASIC miners can\u2019t be repurposed, making them a huge contributor to toxic e-waste.\n\u2022  A 2021 study estimated that Bitcoin mining produces 30,000+ tons of e-waste annually\u2014comparable to the waste output of a country like Luxembourg.\n\n3.   Water Consumption & Thermal Pollution\n\u2022  Data centers and mining farms require cooling systems, which consume large amounts of water or air-conditioning energy.\n\u2022  In some regions, crypto mining has led to increased water stress or local overheating of aquatic ecosystems.\n\n4.   Land & Resource Depletion\n\u2022  Mining requires large land areas, displacing communities and damaging local environments.\n\u2022  The production of mining equipment requires rare earth metals, contributing to habitat destruction and extraction-related pollution.\n\nSome mining firms are shifting to renewable energy, but fossil fuels still dominate.\nGovernments & organizations are pushing for stricter regulations and carbon-neutral crypto projects.\n\nIf you care about the environment, if you care about ethics, if you don\u2019t want to support criminals behaviour, (Cryptocurrency is used by criminals to hide their financial dealings and/or to prevent paying taxes), then don\u2019t jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon until they\u2019ve cleaned their environmental and ethical act!\n\nThink of your offspring.\nDon\u2019t do cryptocurrency!",

Updated Visuals on Magic Eden:\nThe visuals for the STONES on Magic Eden are currently being updated to load quickly. Soon, it will also be possible to view the stone\u2019s native inscription in 3D directly on Magic Eden\u2019s viewer.\n\n    4.

We made significant strides in integrating real-world assets (RWAs) with decentralized finance, laying the groundwork for a more accessible and efficient financial future.\n\nThis year was about more than just achievements\u2014it was about building a solid foundation for what's to come.\n\n---\n\nA Memorable Moment at the WOW Summit\n\nOne of the standout events of 2024 was RealtyX DAO\u2019s participation in the WOW Summit Startup Competition. This was more than just another event; it was an opportunity to showcase our vision for RWA tokenization to a global audience. The response was overwhelming, with industry leaders, investors, and mentors recognizing the immense potential of our platform. The connections we made and the insights we gained have only strengthened our resolve and momentum, reaffirming that we are on the right path.\n\n[Discover more about our WOW Summit experience](https://t.co/n5q4w9WIBi\u2026)\n\n---\n\nProgressing with the SpringX Accelerator\n\nFollowing the WOW Summit, RealtyX DAO was selected to join the SpringX Accelerator program, supported by Aptos and BuidlerDAO. This program is designed to foster blockchain projects with significant potential. The mentorship, resources, and community support we received through SpringX have been invaluable, sharpening our focus and reinforcing our commitment to becoming a leader in RWA tokenization.\n\n[Learn more about our SpringX journey](https://t.co/n5q4w9WIBi\u2026)\n\n---\n\nInnovating through Hong Kong Cyberport\n\nAnother major milestone in 2024 was joining the Hong Kong Cyberport Incubation Program. This program connected us with top-tier resources, investors, and an expansive network of innovators. It has bolstered our ability to develop solutions that bridge traditional assets with blockchain technology, cementing our role as a pioneer in the RWA space.\n\n---\n\nGame-Changing Partnership with @plumenetwork\n\nOur partnership with Plume Network was a game changer for RealtyX DAO. Plume\u2019s infrastructure offers the scalability and robustness necessary to expand our tokenization efforts. This collaboration is set to enhance liquidity, improve capital market efficiency, and make RWAs more accessible to all. It\u2019s a major step toward making RWA finance mainstream.\n\n---\n\nA Community that Powers Our Progress\n\nNone of our achievements would be possible without the incredible support of our community. \n\n- Twitter: Over 77,000 followers actively engaging with our mission.  \n- Discord: More than 45,000 members sharing ideas and collaborating.  \n- Registered Users: Over 4,000 exploring the potential of RWAs.  \n- Ambassador Program (RAP): A growing network of global ambassadors spreading our vision.  \n\nThis strong community is what drives us forward, and we remain committed to strengthening it.\n\n--\n\nLooking Ahead: The $RX Token Generation Event\n\nIn February 2025, RealtyX DAO will reach a major milestone with the RX Token Generation Event (TGE). This isn\u2019t just a technical achievement\u2014it marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for our ecosystem. The RX token will unlock new features, deepen community engagement, and solidify our position within RWA finance. The anticipation is palpable, and the impact will be significant.\n\n---\n\nBuilding on a Strong Foundation\n\nReflecting on 2024, we are incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Strategic partnerships, ecosystem growth, and community support have laid a solid foundation for the future. As we move into 2025, our focus remains on innovation, utility, and widespread adoption. We\u2019re working on new features to maximize user benefits and expand our RWA offerings, while also pursuing additional licenses to ensure compliance and open new markets.\n\nThe opportunities ahead are vast, and RealtyX DAO is ready to lead the charge in connecting real-world assets with decentralized finance.",

The technological breakthrough of crypto allows people to move value as easily/cheaply as they currently move data (text, images, etc) on the internet. The internet democratized access to information and crypto can democratize the financial system. Virtually every central bank (other than the Fed) is exploring how to issue currency using the technology and virtually all the world\u2019s major payment firms are integrating the tech into their systems. Half a billion people use crypto currencies around the world, including as a store of value, to protect themselves against inflation and as a payment mechanism.  Making wild generalizations about the policy views of the crypto industry and ignoring the transformational potential of the tech is a mistake on your part.  Not everyone in crypto may be your cup of tea, but most of the people in the sector are building the financial infrastructure of the future and are worth learning more about.",

By anchoring transactions in a chain of proof-of-work, we create an immutable ledger resistant to tampering. Each node enforces the rules, and miners compete to extend the blockchain, their energy expenditure securing the network against revision. This is not mere code; it is an economic system where incentives align to punish dishonesty and reward honest participation.\n\nCentral authorities introduce fragility. They demand trust while hoarding control, a paradox Bitcoin dissolves. The blockchain\u2019s transparency allows verification, not faith. When you transact, you do not rely on banks or governments\u2014only mathematics. The double-spending problem, once a specter haunting digital cash, is exorcised through decentralization.\n\n\"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\" This is not abstraction. It is a scaffold for autonomy, built on cryptographic primitives and game theory. \n\nNodes propagate truth; miners cement it.\n\nYet Bitcoin remains a work in progress. Scalability challenges\u2014block size, throughput\u2014will demand solutions that preserve decentralization. \n\nThe network must evolve without succumbing to central pressures. As adoption grows, so too will its resilience.\n\nTo question Bitcoin\u2019s value is to question the value of freedom itself. Gold derives worth from scarcity and utility; Bitcoin transcends by merging scarcity with incorruptible issuance. Its monetary policy is encoded, predictable, and unyielding to human whim.\n\nThe future? A world where financial sovereignty is as fundamental as speech. Where intermediaries atrophy, and individuals reclaim agency. This is not utopia\u2014it is protocol.\n\nFinality resides in the blocks.",

        "Tweet": "The phenomenon where people invest in questionable cryptocurrencies, such as those that are premined or centralized despite promises of decentralization, can be attributed to several psychological and situational factors:\n\n1 Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Investors are driven by the fear of missing out on potential high returns, especially after seeing others succeed with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n2 Greed: The promise of quick and high profits attracts individuals who prioritize financial gains over thorough due diligence.\n\n3 Social Proof: People are influenced by the popularity of these coins on social media and forums, mistaking popularity for legitimacy without verifying facts.\n\n4 Optimism Bias: Investors may believe they will succeed where others fail, underestimating the risks involved.\n\n5 Lack of Knowledge: Many investors may not fully understand the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies, making them vulnerable to scams.\n\n6 Desperation for Financial Gains: Some individuals take high risks due to financial desperation, hoping for quick returns despite the odds.\n\n7 Pump and Dump Schemes: Scammers exploit these factors by artificially inflating prices (pumping) and then selling off their holdings (dumping), leaving other investors with losses.\n\n8 Lack of Regulation: The crypto market's lack of regulation provides scammers with opportunities to operate with less accountability.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't a single psychological term for this behavior, it is a combination of FOMO, greed, social proof, optimism bias, and a lack of knowledge, compounded by the crypto market's unique environment. Investors are motivated by the desire for quick profits without fully understanding the risks or mechanisms behind these investments.",

        "Tweet": "The danger of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is the major tool for cybercrime, drug trade, and money laundering; it\u2019s the coin for crooks who seek to hide their financial dealings!\n\nBut there are other important dangers.\n\nCryptocurrency comes with significant risks, both for individual investors and for broader economic systems.  Here are the key dangers:\n\n1.   Extreme Volatility\n\u2022  Prices can skyrocket or crash unpredictably, leading to massive financial losses.\n\u2022  Examples: Bitcoin crashed over 80% in 2018 and Terra/LUNA collapsed in 2022, wiping out billions.\n\n2.   Fraud & Scams\n\u2022  Ponzi schemes: Fake crypto projects promising high returns. (e.g., BitConnect scam).\n\u2022  Pump-and-dump schemes: Groups artificially inflate prices before selling off, leaving others with worthless assets.\n\u2022  Rug pulls: Developers abandon a project after collecting investors\u2019 funds.\n\n3.   Lack of Regulation & Consumer Protections\n\u2022  Unlike banks, crypto exchanges can collapse without protection.\n\u2022  Example: FTX exchange bankruptcy (2022)\u2014users lost billions with no recourse.\n\n4.    Hacking & Security Risks\n\u2022  Crypto wallets and exchanges are prime targets for hackers.\n\u2022 bExample: Mt. Gox hack (2014)\u2014lost 850,000 Bitcoin (worth over $50 billion today).\n\u2022  No way to recover lost private keys\u2014once gone, funds are irretrievable.\n\n5.   Environmental Impact\n\u2022  Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries.\n\u2022   Heavy use of fossil fuels for mining increases carbon emissions.\n\n6.   Illegal Activities\n\u2022  Cryptocurrencies are used for money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, and ransomware payments.\n\u2022  Dark web marketplaces like Silk Road relied on Bitcoin.\n\n7.   Market Manipulation\n\u2022  Whales (large holders) can control the market, causing artificial price swings.\n\u2022  Elon Musk\u2019s tweets have dramatically affected Dogecoin and Bitcoin prices. (This is well documented).  He likely owns much Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and thus has enormous influence over its behaviour.\n\n8.   Speculation Over Practical Use\n\u2022  Many cryptocurrencies lack real-world use beyond trading.\n\u2022   Only a few, like Ethereum, have practical applications (smart contracts, DeFi).\n\n9.   Loss of Funds Due to Human Error\n\u2022  Sending crypto to the wrong address is irreversible.\n\u2022  Forgetting or losing a private key means total loss of funds.\n\n10.   Government Crackdowns\n\u2022  Some countries ban or restrict crypto use (e.g., China, India).\n\u2022  Governments may introduce Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to replace decentralized cryptos.\n\nWhilst cryptocurrency offers decentralization and financial innovation, it also presents severe risks due to volatility, lack of protection, hacking threats, and legal uncertainties.\n\nUnless you want to support criminals, better wait investing/dealing in Cryptocurrency till it\u2019s better regulated.\n\nCryptocurrency is illegal in several countries, exactly for this reason.",

        "Tweet": "One of the biggest challenges in crypto liquidity is volatility. The prices of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate wildly and unpredictably, which makes it difficult for traders to buy or sell assets without causing significant price changes. This volatility can deter investors and reduce overall market participation, leading to lower liquidity.\n\nOther challenges include the regulatory environment, which can be complex and ever-changing, and security concerns, as decentralized systems can be vulnerable to hacks and fraud. Additionally, integrating crypto markets with traditional financial systems can also pose challenges.",

        "Tweet": "Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This ensures transparency and security, as all participants in the network can view the entire transaction history.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Transaction Initiation**: When a transaction occurs (like a cryptocurrency transfer), it is initiated by a user.\n\n2. **Block Creation**: The transaction is grouped with other transactions into a block. This block contains details such as transaction time, sender, receiver, and the transaction amount.\n\n3. **Verification**: The block is then sent to a network of computers (nodes) for verification. Nodes check the validity of the transaction against consensus rules, ensuring that the sender has sufficient balance and that the transaction follows all protocols.\n\n4. **Adding to the Chain**: Once verified, the block is added to the existing chain of blocks (the blockchain). Each block contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them securely.\n\n5. **Decentralization and Security**: The blockchain is maintained by all the nodes in the network, meaning there is no central authority. This decentralization makes it resistant to fraud and hacking, as altering any information would require changing all subsequent blocks across many nodes.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, blockchain is vital because it ensures trust and security in transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. This allows for peer-to-peer transactions, reduces costs, and increases transaction speed, making cryptocurrencies a revolutionary force in finance.\n\nStock symbol: $BULT\n\n#crypto #cryptocurrency #btc #ethereum #investing #money #forex #investment #bult #bultstock",

Updated Visuals on Magic Eden:\nThe visuals for the STONES on Magic Eden are currently being updated to load quickly. Soon, it will also be possible to view the stone\u2019s native inscription in 3D directly on Magic Eden\u2019s viewer.\n\n    4.    I will be hosting / co-hosting  one Space per week on Twitter and one on the collection\u2019s Discord to stay in touch with the community and provide live updates on the project\u2019s progress.\n\n\n    5.    Rune Token \u201cLord.Of.The.Stones\u201d Airdrop:\n\n\nThe date for the Rune Token airdrop will also be revealed at the beginning of next week.

It represents the sum of assets that users have locked into smart contracts on a particular platform. \nTVL is often used as an indicator of the health, popularity, and security of a DeFi project; the higher the TVL, the more trust and investment the protocol has attracted. These assets can include cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or other tokens, which are staked, lent, or used in other yield-generating activities. \nMonitoring TVL helps investors and users gauge the risk and potential return, as well as understand the liquidity and overall engagement with the DeFi ecosystem.",

We made significant strides in integrating real-world assets (RWAs) with decentralized finance, laying the groundwork for a more accessible and efficient financial future.\n\nThis year was about more than just achievements\u2014it was about building a solid foundation for what's to come.\n\n---\n\nA Memorable Moment at the WOW Summit\n\nOne of the standout events of 2024 was RealtyX DAO\u2019s participation in the WOW Summit Startup Competition. This was more than just another event; it was an opportunity to showcase our vision for RWA tokenization to a global audience. The response was overwhelming, with industry leaders, investors, and mentors recognizing the immense potential of our platform. The connections we made and the insights we gained have only strengthened our resolve and momentum, reaffirming that we are on the right path.\n\n[Discover more about our WOW Summit experience](https://t.co/n5q4w9WIBi\u2026)\n\n---\n\nProgressing with the SpringX Accelerator\n\nFollowing the WOW Summit, RealtyX DAO was selected to join the SpringX Accelerator program, supported by Aptos and BuidlerDAO. This program is designed to foster blockchain projects with significant potential. The mentorship, resources, and community support we received through SpringX have been invaluable, sharpening our focus and reinforcing our commitment to becoming a leader in RWA tokenization.\n\n[Learn more about our SpringX journey](https://t.co/n5q4w9WIBi\u2026)\n\n---\n\nInnovating through Hong Kong Cyberport\n\nAnother major milestone in 2024 was joining the Hong Kong Cyberport Incubation Program. This program connected us with top-tier resources, investors, and an expansive network of innovators. It has bolstered our ability to develop solutions that bridge traditional assets with blockchain technology, cementing our role as a pioneer in the RWA space.\n\n---\n\nGame-Changing Partnership with @plumenetwork\n\nOur partnership with Plume Network was a game changer for RealtyX DAO. Plume\u2019s infrastructure offers the scalability and robustness necessary to expand our tokenization efforts. This collaboration is set to enhance liquidity, improve capital market efficiency, and make RWAs more accessible to all. It\u2019s a major step toward making RWA finance mainstream.\n\n---\n\nA Community that Powers Our Progress\n\nNone of our achievements would be possible without the incredible support of our community. \n\n- Twitter: Over 77,000 followers actively engaging with our mission.  \n- Discord: More than 45,000 members sharing ideas and collaborating.  \n- Registered Users: Over 4,000 exploring the potential of RWAs.  \n- Ambassador Program (RAP): A growing network of global ambassadors spreading our vision.  \n\nThis strong community is what drives us forward, and we remain committed to strengthening it.\n\n--\n\nLooking Ahead: The $RX Token Generation Event\n\nIn February 2025, RealtyX DAO will reach a major milestone with the RX Token Generation Event (TGE). This isn\u2019t just a technical achievement\u2014it marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for our ecosystem. The RX token will unlock new features, deepen community engagement, and solidify our position within RWA finance. The anticipation is palpable, and the impact will be significant.\n\n---\n\nBuilding on a Strong Foundation\n\nReflecting on 2024, we are incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Strategic partnerships, ecosystem growth, and community support have laid a solid foundation for the future. As we move into 2025, our focus remains on innovation, utility, and widespread adoption. We\u2019re working on new features to maximize user benefits and expand our RWA offerings, while also pursuing additional licenses to ensure compliance and open new markets.\n\nThe opportunities ahead are vast, and RealtyX DAO is ready to lead the charge in connecting real-world assets with decentralized finance.",

(Timothy Kisambira)\n\nEven as the mining sector struggles to put in basic infrastructure for international best practices, officials say the sector remains on course to \u2018green mining,\u2019 its goal under the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS II).\n\nGreen mining is defined as technologies, best practices to reduce the environmental impacts associated with the extraction and processing of metals and minerals.\u00a0\n\nIt includes reduction of greenhouse gases, selective mining approaches to reduce the ecological footprint, and reduction in chemical use, among others.\n\nPart of requisite basic infrastructure for transformation to green mining is establishment of a model mine from which all players in the sector will learn from.\n\nAlthough it is yet to be achieved, more than a year into the five-year EDPRS II, Dr Michael Biryabarema, the Deputy Director General of Mines and Geology, says that a model mine is possible in the next two years after \"all the good practices have been introduced.\u201d\n\n\"This is just one year [after EDPRS II launch]. It\u2019s a jigsaw puzzle of a number of things that must be put together such that we can then say that we have a green mine. But in the next two years, we should have a pretty good example of a good mine,\u201d Biryabarema said.\u00a0\n\n\"We want to see investors and communities in mineral areas benefiting from mines. What we are doing now is introducing all aspects of good practice as we roll out green and sustainable mining.\u201d\n\nDr Evode Imena, State Minister in charge of mining, told Sunday Times that establishment of a model mine was a plan under development. He said mines had been identified, at least one in every province, that can be used as models.\n\n\"We use them for \u2018come and see, learn, go and implement\u2019 purposes,\u201d the minister said.\n\nEven though the mines \u2013 including HABATU Mining and H&B Mining (Tantalum ore) in Rwamagana District \u2013 are good examples, it is said they are still being transformed and cannot be referred to as examples of best practices.\n\nOthers in a similar ranking, according to Francis Kayumba, the director of regulations and inspection, are CEMINYAKI and COMINYABU cassiterite (for tin) and coltan (for tantalite) cooperatives\u2019 mines located in Rubavu District.\n\nMining is a strategic sector in EDPRS II.

Here's a general guide to get you started:\n\n1. Research and Education\nLearn About Gold: Understand the geology of gold, how it forms, and where it's found. Gold is often found in igneous and metamorphic rocks or in alluvial deposits (like riverbeds).\n\nStudy Mining Methods: There are various methods like placer mining, hard rock mining, and by-product mining. Each has its specifics, equipment needs, and environmental impacts.\n\r2. Legal Considerations\nPermits and Regulations: Mining is heavily regulated. You need to obtain mining rights, which might involve:\nClaim Staking: In some countries like the USA, you can stake a claim on public land for mining. This involves physically marking the area and recording it with the appropriate government body.\n\nLease or Purchase: In other areas, you might need to lease or buy land with known gold deposits.\n\rEnvironmental Permits: Ensure compliance with environmental protection laws which might require an environmental impact study.\n\r3. Location Selection\nProspecting: Use geological maps, satellite imagery, or hire a geologist to identify potential gold-bearing areas. \n\nField Tests: Panning or using more advanced detection equipment like metal detectors or geophysical tools can help confirm gold presence.\n\r4. Equipment and Setup\nBasic Tools: For small-scale operations, you might start with simple tools like pans, sluices, or even dry-washers for desert areas.\n\nHeavy Equipment: For larger operations, you'll need excavators, bulldozers, crushers, and processing plants. \n\nSafety Gear: Helmets, protective clothing, and possibly respiratory equipment are essential.\n\r5. Mining\nExtraction: Depending on your site:\nPlacer Mining: Use water to separate gold from sediment.\n\nHard Rock Mining: Drill, blast, and crush rock to extract gold veins.\n\rProcessing: \nGravity Separation: Gold's density helps separate it from other materials.\n\nChemical Extraction: Using cyanide or mercury (though mercury use is decreasing due to health and environmental concerns).\n\r6. Refining\nGold from mining needs to be refined to increase its purity. This can be done through:\nSmelting: Melting the gold with fluxes to remove impurities.\n\nElectrolysis: For highly purified gold.\n\r7. Marketing and Sales\nDecide how you'll sell your gold - directly to refineries, through dealers, or by other means.\n\r8. Environmental Responsibility\nPlan for land reclamation and management of any waste produced during mining to mitigate environmental impact.\n\r9. Economic Viability\nCalculate all costs including equipment, labor, land, permits, and refining. Gold prices fluctuate, so ensure your operation can remain profitable.\n\r10. Ongoing Education\nKeep learning; mining technology and regulations evolve.\n\rRemember, gold mining can be capital-intensive with significant environmental impacts, so thorough planning and adherence to regulations are key to successful and sustainable operations. If you're new to this, starting with smaller scale or joining an existing operation might be a wise approach.", "Date Posted": "2025-02-06T09:21:54.000Z"}, {"Handle": "bytecoderman", "Followers": 517, "Likes": 1, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "space mining is the next trillion-dollar gold rush\n\nmajor players racing to extract metals from asteroids:\n\nAstroForge: literally just raised $13M for asteroid prospecting \nTransAstra: developing water extraction tech\nOffWorld: building autonomous mining bots\nKarman: focusing on in-space manufacturing + resource processing\n\nno hype - just cold hard asteroid facts: single platinum-rich asteroid could = entire world's reserves\n\nhonestly wild to think we're about to start strip mining space rocks for profit", "Date Posted": "2025-02-08T03:09:25.000Z"}, {"Handle": "bzequity100", "Followers": 293, "Likes": 7, "Retweets": 2, "Tweet": "Malawi\u2019s mining boom is set to reshape the economy by 2025, with Kayelekera Uranium and Kangankunde Rare Earth mines leading the way.

Here\u2019s a summarized resum\u00e9 of why people believe in crypto, based on our entire discussion:\n\n1. The Banking System is Rigged\n\nCentral banks are semi-private institutions that serve elite financial interests, not the public.\nBanks don\u2019t actually lend existing money\u2014they create money out of thin air through loans, profiting off debt.\nGovernments and banks manipulate inflation and interest rates, keeping people trapped in cycles of debt.\nCrypto removes the need for banks, allowing people to hold and transfer money without middlemen.\n2. Inflation is Stealing People\u2019s Wealth\n\nGovernments print money endlessly, reducing the purchasing power of citizens.\n\nFiat currency (paper money) is only valuable because people trust it\u2014but when trust breaks (like in Venezuela), it becomes worthless.\nBitcoin is limited to 21 million coins\u2014no central bank can print more, making it inflation-proof.\nStablecoins like USDT allow people to escape collapsing national currencies.\n3. The Financial System Forces NPCs to Trust It\nMost people don\u2019t realize banks can freeze accounts, control transactions, and dictate who gets loans.\n\nThe modern economy forces dependence on banks\u2014but crypto allows people to store and move money without permission.\n\nIn countries with authoritarian governments, Bitcoin is the only way to protect assets.\n\ud83d\udccc Example: In Lebanon\u2019s banking crisis (2019), people\u2019s accounts were frozen. Those who had Bitcoin could still move money.\n4. Traditional Finance is Controlled by the Elite\nThe U.S. dollar dominates global trade, and the U.S. can weaponize it against other nations (e.g., sanctions against Russia, Iran).\n\nBanks collude with governments to bail out institutions like JPMorgan, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs\u2014but regular people get no bailouts.\n\nCrypto gives financial power back to individuals instead of central banks and corporate elites.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Example: In 2008, banks got bailed out after causing the crisis, while millions lost their homes. Crypto was created as a response to this corruption.\n5. Trust in Governments and Institutions is Breaking Down\nThe U.S. is drowning in $34 trillion of debt, and most economic \u201cgrowth\u201d is just artificial money printing.\nThe media, government, and financial institutions lie about inflation, economic stability, and banking risks.\n\nCrypto is trustless\u2014it operates on mathematical rules, not political manipulation.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Example: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need a government, bank, or CEO to function\u2014it runs on code, and no one can change its supply.\n\n6. Crypto is a Hedge Against Collapse\nHyperinflation, government crackdowns, and global financial instability are growing.\nEl Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender to escape reliance on the U.S. dollar.\nMore people in Argentina, Turkey, Nigeria, and Venezuela are using crypto because their local currencies are collapsing.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Example: If you\u2019re in a country where inflation is 200% (like Argentina), you\u2019d rather hold Bitcoin or stablecoins than the national currency.\n\nFinal Summary: Why People Believe in Crypto\n\n\u2705 Banks and central banks are corrupt and self-serving.\n\u2705 Inflation destroys savings, but Bitcoin is scarce and inflation-proof.\n\u2705 Crypto removes the need for banks and financial elites.\n\u2705 Governments weaponize currency, but Bitcoin is borderless and neutral.\n\u2705 Trust in traditional institutions is breaking, but crypto is trustless.\n\u2705 More people in unstable economies are turning to crypto to escape financial collapse.\n\ud83d\udc49 Bottom Line: People believe in crypto because it\u2019s the only real alternative to a broken, corrupt financial system controlled by governments and banks.", "Date Posted": "2025-02-07T17:06:11.000Z"}, {"Handle": "altradyapp", "Followers": 1987, "Likes": 3, "Retweets": 1, "Tweet": "\ud83d\udca1 Why Utility Drives Crypto Adoption\n\nThe more real-world problems a cryptocurrency solves, the faster it earns its place in the market. \n\nFrom Bitcoin as a store of value in unstable economies to Ethereum powering DeFi and NFTs, utility is what sets tokens apart.\n\nWant to know how features like security, market stability, and regulatory acceptance shape adoption?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Read the full article to see what makes a cryptocurrency indispensable \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://t.co/APAjq95xTk", "Date Posted": "2025-02-04T13:16:30.000Z"}, {"Handle": "typesteady", "Followers": 301, "Likes": 2, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "Crypto markets are a bi-product of blockchain, when you understand it\u2019s taken years for blockchain adoption simply because the sheer level of disruption the tech brings to legacy systems. \n\nSome people don\u2019t quite understand when you consume a node on chain that represents a real world asset such as money or data that this can drive price leaving less tokens available causing supply/demand.

We're talking about a financial environment where the SEC, CFTC, or any other watchdog can't effectively protect you from fraud or market manipulation.\n\n- **Pump and Dumps, Scams Galore:** The crypto market is a breeding ground for scams. From Ponzi schemes to rug pulls, where developers suddenly abandon a 'project' after hyping it up, the number of scams is staggering. No accountability\n\n# # 2. *Volatility and Speculation:*\n\n- **Not Currency, But Gambling:** Cryptocurrencies are touted as money, but their value fluctuates like a roller coaster ride. This isn't currency; it's a speculative asset where the only way to \"win\" is if someone else loses. The promise of unreal gains is just that - a promise based on nothing but speculation and hype.\n\n- **Economic Instability:** This volatility can lead to broader economic instability. When people pour their savings into something as unpredictable as crypto, hoping for a quick buck, it diverts capital from more stable, productive investments. We're essentially encouraging a form of financial gambling with no safety net.\n\n# # 3. **Anonymity and Illicit Activities:**\n\n- **Facilitating Crime:** The anonymity or pseudo-anonymity of transactions makes cryptocurrencies a go-to for money laundering, tax evasion, and funding illegal activities. It's like giving criminals a new, untraceable form of cash. \n\n- **Privacy vs. Accountability:** While some argue for privacy in transactions, this anonymity is a double-edged sword that undermines legal and financial accountability.\n\n# # 4. **Inequality and Wealth Concentration:**\n\n- **Benefiting the Few:** Only those with disposable income can afford to risk money in such a volatile market. This means crypto gains are concentrated among the already wealthy, exacerbating economic inequality. It's not about democratizing finance; it's about creating a new elite in the digital age.\nHere's the replacement paragraph focusing on energy demand and prices:\n\n# # 5. **Energy Demand and Prices:**\n\nThe mining of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, requires an enormous amount of electricity, leading to a surge in demand that can drive up energy prices. This increased demand affects not just individual consumers but also businesses, potentially raising operational costs across various sectors. In areas where mining operations are concentrated, local energy prices can skyrocket, putting pressure on the electric grid and making it more expensive for everyone to keep the lights on, heat their homes, or run their businesses. It's about basic economics; when demand spikes, unless supply miraculously increases, prices go up, and that's what we're seeing with crypto mining.\n\n# # 6. **Legal and Ethical Nightmare:**\n\n- **Regulatory Arbitrage:** Crypto companies can and do move to wherever regulations are lax, undermining any attempt at fair play. It's a race to the bottom in terms of consumer protection and ethical business practices.\n\n# The CBDC Counterargument:\n\nNow, if we want the technology without the chaos, consider Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). They would give us the convenience and technological benefits of digital transactions but with banks as custodians, removing the anonymity that breeds crime, and eliminating the wild speculation that leads to scams and unreal gains. It's embracing the tech but with the necessary oversight and stability.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIt's time to call this experiment what it often is - a scam wrapped in technological jargon, and it's time for the USA to take decisive action.", "Date Posted": "2025-02-03T13:15:11.000Z"}, {"Handle": "trilllllllllly", "Followers": 2440, "Likes": 0, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.
