If you were incapable of verifying illicit activity and responding to it maybe you should consult us experts or any other reputable entity. Crying babies\u2026.we just want wallet drainers stopped!!!! But you had to make Saiyan angry so now I\u2019m in god of destruction mode\n\nPart 1 Act 1:\nIn late 2024, eXch, a crypto exchange under increasing scrutiny @exchcx made my tweet list for its involvement in illicit activities tied to massive crypto thefts, particularly those linked to Inferno Drainer. Inferno? A notorious phishing kit, responsible for countless losses across the crypto community. Several malicious actors are using its kit to drain unsuspecting victims\u2019 wallets. Recently that infrastructure was transferred to Angel Drainer. There are no mistakes about eXch\u2019s connections to enabling these schemes. \n\nAct 2:\nThe small drama peaked when prominent crypto researchers like  @Intell_On_Chain , known for tracking and exposing blockchain fraud, openly called out eXch on @x , having already exposed ties between eXch and scams happening on chain \u26d3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udca5 . In emails, JP became the target of eXch\u2019s retaliation. Instead of addressing the mounting evidence, eXch went on the offensive, responding with a peculiar mix of deflection and personal attacks. In an almost surreal move, eXch\u2019s official email response questioned JP,  of IOC, about his use of Outlook and iOS. The focus on such trivial matters deflected from the real issue: eXch\u2019s direct or indirect involvement with crypto theft operations.\n\nAct 3:\nMany of the replies to my posts were suspiciously hostile, accusing me of lacking skill in tracking scams\u2026comments that seemed coordinated, as if eXch was deploying bots or paid users to discredit the investigations I\u2019ve supported. These insulting responses were empty given my \u201cwanna be\u201d status amongst the skids. Tracked plenty of fraudulent activities, especially wallet drainers whom recommend eXch for use.\n\nPart 2 Act 1: in this saga @etherscan , a highly respected Ethereum block explorer, labeled eXch as an illicit entity. This formal designation cemented the exchange\u2019s reputation as a hub for illegal activities. eXch, already sensitive to its growing public scrutiny, responded. While the Etherscan label was rooted in connecting evidence and accidental, eXch\u2019s reaction seemed more emotional than logical\u2014indicative of an organization whose illicit bed sheets were being exposed.\n\nFinal Act:\n\nThey recently posted a demand letter on bitcoin talk, apparently having a tantrum over the scrutiny. If more was done, the @fbi @IRS_CI @SlowMist_Team @MistTrack_io \n@SECGov and others might not feel so strongly. Most of us understand privacy is valued, however safety and accountability on chain is also valued. @bitcointalk @trmlabs \nDespite eXch\u2019s attempts to deflect criticism and undermine the credibility of those exposing them, the crypto community remained unphased. I responded to the shady dealings and accusations. I\u2019ll respond again. The backlash against eXch\u2019s tactics highlight the growing frustration in the crypto space toward platforms that facilitate theft and fraud while dodging accountability. \n\nEpilogue: \n@exchcx\u2019s efforts to downplay and deflect accusations of illicit activity have only deepened our watch surrounding their operations. They have ties to allowing Inferno Drainer and other malicious actors to escape free. Along with their odd engagement with critics on social media, despite the fact all we care about is making victims whole, this makes an interesting dramatic. \n\nFew tags I hope are interested \ud83c\udf7f @evilcos @_SEAL_Org @Plumferno @cryptoShields @Gi7w0rm @1c4m3by @realScamSniffer @FDICgov @tayvano_ \n\n#crime #fbi #illicit #saiyan", "Date Posted": "2025-02-02T00:15:46.000Z"}, {"Handle": "Mido_riya5", "Followers": 597, "Likes": 72, "Retweets": 10, "Tweet": "Crypto\u2019s biggest problem isn't scalability; it's actually trust.\n\nWithout a system to verify trust and reputation, bad actors exploit others with zero accountability.\n\nFraud and scams have stained crypto\u2019s image, leaving the public skeptical.\n\nHow do we expect mass adoption when trust is nonexistent ?", "Date Posted": "2025-02-07T10:07:18.000Z"}, {"Handle": "OkenwaCrypto1", "Followers": 866, "Likes": 4, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "Steer clear of fraudulent coins, also known as low-value coins.

While it provides anonymity and convenience, it also poses significant risks of addiction and financial ruin. Let's delve into the pros and cons. \ud83c\udfb2\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThread:\n1/ Cryptocurrency gambling may seem like a modern and convenient way to engage in online betting, but it comes with its own set of dangers. The ease of access and pseudo-anonymity can make it particularly enticing for vulnerable individuals.\n\n2/ The allure of quick profits and the adrenaline rush of high-stakes gambling can lead to impulsive decision-making and significant financial losses. Without proper safeguards and self-control, cryptocurrency gambling can spiral into addiction.\n\n3/ On the flip side, the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies offers transparency and security in transactions, potentially minimizing the risks of fraud and manipulation in online gambling platforms. However, it's crucial to balance these benefits with the potential pitfalls.\n\n4/ As with any form of gambling, responsible behavior and awareness are key. Educating oneself about the risks, setting limits, and seeking help if needed are essential steps in navigating the world of cryptocurrency gambling.

Before getting sucked into the shitcoin bubble, perform thorough research.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Pump-and-Dump Scams\nPump-and-dump scams thrive on the allure of massive returns.

To safeguard your funds, consider using hardware wallets, setting up PINs through your mobile carriers, and regularly monitoring your accounts.\n\n\u2705 Tips to Stay Safe:\n\n1. Research Thoroughly: Evaluate the cryptocurrency\u2019s background. Transparency is key.\n2. Use Secure Wallets: Offline hardware wallets are best, however, if you use an online wallet, double check their security features.\n3. Protect Your Seed Phrase: Never share your seed phrase aka your master key; store it securely and in an offline location(s).\n4. Be Scam-Aware: Ignore \u201ctoo good to believe\u201d opportunities and promises of guaranteed quick returns. Never click on suspicious links or share sensitive information.\n5. Diversify: The more the merrier. Spread your investments to minimize risk.\n\nWhile the crypto world is exciting, it\u2019s not without risks.

This transparency helps in reducing fraud and increasing trust among users.\n\u00a0\n- **Disintermediation**: DeFi removes the need for traditional financial intermediaries like banks, brokers, or insurance companies. This can lead to faster transactions, lower fees, and direct control over one's financial assets.\n\u00a0\n- **Accessibility**: Anyone with internet access can potentially use DeFi services, which is particularly beneficial for those who are unbanked or underbanked, providing financial services to people in regions where traditional banking might not be accessible or efficient.\n\u00a0\n- **Decentralized Control**: Instead of centralized control by institutions, DeFi operates on smart contracts that automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met, reducing the risk of manipulation by any single entity.\n\u00a0\n- **Financial Inclusion**: By leveraging blockchain, DeFi can offer financial services like loans, savings, and insurance without the need for credit checks or other traditional barriers, thus broadening financial inclusion.\n\u00a0\n- **Innovation in Finance**: DeFi encourages innovation with new financial products like yield farming, liquidity pools, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing users with novel ways to invest, earn, and manage their assets.\n\u00a0\n- **Privacy**: Users can often transact with greater privacy, as personal identity isn't necessarily tied to blockchain transactions, although this varies with different DeFi platforms and regulations.\n\u00a0\n- **Portability**: Digital assets on blockchain are not bound by national borders, facilitating international transactions without the typical fees or delays associated with cross-border banking.\n\u00a0\n- **24/7 Operations**: Unlike traditional finance which operates within business hours, DeFi platforms can function around the clock, allowing for constant access to financial services.\n\u00a0\n- **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: In traditional finance, you rely on the solvency and honesty of the counterparty (e.g., a bank). In DeFi, smart contracts execute automatically, reducing this risk.\n\u00a0\nHowever, these benefits come with challenges like scalability issues, regulatory concerns, and the complexity of managing one's own keys or understanding smart contract risks. Users should approach DeFi with caution, ensuring they understand the technologies and the inherent risks involved.", "Date Posted": "2025-02-06T09:29:44.000Z"}, {"Handle": "velesfinance", "Followers": 3191, "Likes": 0, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "How DeFi is changing the banking system: a glimpse into the future\n\nThe traditional banking system has remained unchanged for decades: centralized structures, strict controls, and middlemen standing between you and your money.
