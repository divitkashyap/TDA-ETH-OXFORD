Many users see Bitcoin as \"digital gold,\" holding it for long-term investment rather than using it for everyday purchases. The main reasons for this trend include:\n\n1. High Transaction Fees and Low Scalability\n\nBitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which makes transaction validation energy-intensive and costly. When the network is congested, transaction fees can rise significantly, making small payments impractical.\n\nCompared to modern payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, which can process thousands of transactions per second, Bitcoin's speed of 7 TPS (transactions per second) is quite slow.\n\n2. Hodling (HODL) Mentality\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s historical value growth, many people prefer to hold it as a speculative investment, hoping the price will increase over time.\n\nThis creates a paradox: if everyone wants to hold Bitcoin and not spend it, it fails to fulfill its original purpose as \"electronic cash.\"\n\n3. Regulations and Tax Implications\n\nIn many countries, Bitcoin is treated more as an asset than a currency, requiring users to report and pay capital gains tax on every transaction. This makes using Bitcoin for everyday purchases impractical compared to regular fiat currency.\n\n4. The Fundamental Spending Paradox\n\nEven if various scalability solutions manage to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper, the fundamental issue remains: do people actually want to spend Bitcoin?\n\nThe current market dynamics suggest that the answer is no. Most Bitcoin holders perceive it as a long-term asset rather than a currency for daily transactions. This creates an economic paradox:\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price is expected to rise over time, people are reluctant to spend it because each Bitcoin could be worth much more in the future.\n\nIf Bitcoin becomes widely used and its price stabilizes, it loses much of its speculative appeal, which could reduce investor interest.\n\nThis contradiction makes Bitcoin\u2019s widespread adoption as an everyday payment method challenging, regardless of technical advancements. So, even if Bitcoin can theoretically compete with traditional payment systems, practically, human psychology and market behavior stand in the way. \n#BTC", "Date Posted": "2025-02-05T05:13:32.000Z"}, {"Handle": "docjaph", "Followers": 1913, "Likes": 2, "Retweets": 2, "Tweet": "The population of Nigeria is increasing at a worrisome rate. \nMost people are giving birth to children they neither have plans nor the capacity to train.\nThe implications of this are far-reaching...", "Date Posted": "2025-02-08T18:15:42.000Z"}, {"Handle": "drweyoms", "Followers": 9826, "Likes": 0, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "Many of the challenges in our communities\u2014youth unemployment and underemployment, poor healthcare, discrimination, and environmental degradation\u2014require bold voices and innovative solutions. https://t.co/apsItEXxpK https://t.co/OUpPtsz68m", "Date Posted": "2025-02-07T21:24:20.000Z"}, {"Handle": "peezNcairots", "Followers": 190, "Likes": 1, "Retweets": 0, "Tweet": "You ask, \"What is the problem?\" The answer: Year after year of drought.
