Crypto’s biggest problem isn't scalability; it's actually trust.

Without a system to verify trust and reputation, bad actors exploit others with zero accountability.

Fraud and scams have stained crypto’s image, leaving the public skeptical.

How do we expect mass adoption when trust is nonexistent ?The repeal of SAB 121 has brought the long-standing debate over institutional adoption versus self-custody back into focus. Some see institutional involvement as a way to drive mainstream adoption and liquidity. Others fear it dilutes Bitcoin's decentralized nature. https://t.co/mWnBAS6gGPThe cryptocurrency market presents considerable volatility and unpredictability.  When traditional risk assets cease to offer safety and predictable returns, investors may shift towards cryptocurrencies, accepting the inherent risks due to global economic stagnation and other systemic issues.  Consequently, when modest returns fail to outpace inflation, and the erosion of purchasing power outweighs concerns about cryptocurrency's inherent instability, increased cryptocurrency adoption is likely. #Dogecoin #BitcoinBitcoin's advocates mistake decentralization for stability, but it lacks the essential quality of true money: the ability to extinguish tax liabilities. Unlike fiat currency, backed by state spending and taxation, Bitcoin's value is purely speculative, reliant on greater fools. Far from replacing central banks, it mimics gold—scarce, volatile, and ultimately a poor medium of exchange. It is not the future of money, just another asset for speculation, dressed in libertarian fantasy.real estate and crypto can build wealth, but only good health lets you enjoy itGood morning X

SUCK IT UP EXCH!!! 🫰 allow bad stuff, be associated with bad ppl 🤣
Deep embedded in crypto’s dark underbelly is CEX throwing a fit over issues that are their own fault. If you were incapable of verifying illicit activity and responding to it maybe you should consult us experts or any other reputable entity. Crying babies….we just want wallet drainers stopped!!!! But you had to make Saiyan angry so now I’m in god of destruction mode

Part 1 Act 1:
In late 2024, eXch, a crypto exchange under increasing scrutiny @exchcx made my tweet list for its involvement in illicit activities tied to massive crypto thefts, particularly those linked to Inferno Drainer. Inferno? A notorious phishing kit, responsible for countless losses across the crypto community. Several malicious actors are using its kit to drain unsuspecting victims’ wallets. Recently that infrastructure was transferred to Angel Drainer. There are no mistakes about eXch’s connections to enabling these schemes. 

Act 2:
The small drama peaked when prominent crypto researchers like  @Intell_On_Chain , known for tracking and exposing blockchain fraud, openly called out eXch on @x , having already exposed ties between eXch and scams happening on chain ⛓️‍💥 . In emails, JP became the target of eXch’s retaliation. Instead of addressing the mounting evidence, eXch went on the offensive, responding with a peculiar mix of deflection and personal attacks. In an almost surreal move, eXch’s official email response questioned JP,  of IOC, about his use of Outlook and iOS. The focus on such trivial matters deflected from the real issue: eXch’s direct or indirect involvement with crypto theft operations.

Act 3:
Many of the replies to my posts were suspiciously hostile, accusing me of lacking skill in tracking scams…comments that seemed coordinated, as if eXch was deploying bots or paid users to discredit the investigations I’ve supported. These insulting responses were empty given my “wanna be” status amongst the skids. Tracked plenty of fraudulent activities, especially wallet drainers whom recommend eXch for use.

Part 2 Act 1: in this saga @etherscan , a highly respected Ethereum block explorer, labeled eXch as an illicit entity. This formal designation cemented the exchange’s reputation as a hub for illegal activities. eXch, already sensitive to its growing public scrutiny, responded. While the Etherscan label was rooted in connecting evidence and accidental, eXch’s reaction seemed more emotional than logical—indicative of an organization whose illicit bed sheets were being exposed.

Final Act:

They recently posted a demand letter on bitcoin talk, apparently having a tantrum over the scrutiny. If more was done, the @fbi @IRS_CI @SlowMist_Team @MistTrack_io 
@SECGov and others might not feel so strongly. Most of us understand privacy is valued, however safety and accountability on chain is also valued. @bitcointalk @trmlabs 
Despite eXch’s attempts to deflect criticism and undermine the credibility of those exposing them, the crypto community remained unphased. I responded to the shady dealings and accusations. I’ll respond again. The backlash against eXch’s tactics highlight the growing frustration in the crypto space toward platforms that facilitate theft and fraud while dodging accountability. 

Epilogue: 
@exchcx’s efforts to downplay and deflect accusations of illicit activity have only deepened our watch surrounding their operations. They have ties to allowing Inferno Drainer and other malicious actors to escape free. Along with their odd engagement with critics on social media, despite the fact all we care about is making victims whole, this makes an interesting dramatic.

How do we expect mass adoption when trust is nonexistent ?Steer clear of fraudulent coins, also known as low-value coins. These digital currencies frequently lack a strong framework or practical application, rendering them extremely speculative and hazardous investments. 

Numerous coins are established purely to exploit market excitement, resulting in substantial monetary setbacks for unwary investors. Prior to allocating your funds to any virtual asset, 

it is imperative to consistently carry out comprehensive research and due diligence. Bear in mind, if an opportunity appears overly promising, it is likely deceptive.Cryptocurrency gambling offers a double-edged sword. While it provides anonymity and convenience, it also poses significant risks of addiction and financial ruin. Let's delve into the pros and cons. 🎲💰

Thread:
1/ Cryptocurrency gambling may seem like a modern and convenient way to engage in online betting, but it comes with its own set of dangers. The ease of access and pseudo-anonymity can make it particularly enticing for vulnerable individuals.

2/ The allure of quick profits and the adrenaline rush of high-stakes gambling can lead to impulsive decision-making and significant financial losses. Without proper safeguards and self-control, cryptocurrency gambling can spiral into addiction.

3/ On the flip side, the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies offers transparency and security in transactions, potentially minimizing the risks of fraud and manipulation in online gambling platforms. However, it's crucial to balance these benefits with the potential pitfalls.

4/ As with any form of gambling, responsible behavior and awareness are key. Educating oneself about the risks, setting limits, and seeking help if needed are essential steps in navigating the world of cryptocurrency gambling. Stay informed and gamble responsibly. 🎲💻🚨 The Risks of Crypto Investment Scams: What You Need to Know 🚨
Cryptocurrency is transforming the financial world, however, this unregulated environment has growing risks. Exercising caution is a must for every investor—new or experienced.

🛑 Beware of Shitcoins
"Shitcoins" are cryptocurrencies with little to no value; they prey on investors through hyped up social media accounts and influencers. Before getting sucked into the shitcoin bubble, perform thorough research.

📉 Pump-and-Dump Scams
Pump-and-dump scams thrive on the allure of massive returns. Sudden price spikes and crashes, lack of transparency, and insider claims are telling signals. Stay in the know and don’t let FOMO get the best of you.

💥 Exchange Collapses
Centralized platforms can be convenient, but they come with risks like mismanagement and hacking as seen with the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange, FTX in 2022. Be aware of their pitfalls or you may find yourself with a slim chance of fund recovery.

🔓 Hacked Wallets and SIM Swapping
One of the most common ways hackers sneak into online wallets is through SIM swapping. To safeguard your funds, consider using hardware wallets, setting up PINs through your mobile carriers, and regularly monitoring your accounts.

✅ Tips to Stay Safe:

1. Research Thoroughly: Evaluate the cryptocurrency’s background. Transparency is key.
2. Use Secure Wallets: Offline hardware wallets are best, however, if you use an online wallet, double check their security features.
3. Protect Your Seed Phrase: Never share your seed phrase aka your master key; store it securely and in an offline location(s).
4. Be Scam-Aware: Ignore “too good to believe” opportunities and promises of guaranteed quick returns. Never click on suspicious links or share sensitive information.
5. Diversify: The more the merrier. Spread your investments to minimize risk.

While the crypto world is exciting, it’s not without risks. Staying informed and exercising caution will help protect your digital assets. 🌐

It's been standard nomenclature for years, so much so that even the CEX's that we all despise define and use the term the same way other financial sites do.

These people then have the audacity to blame you, the victim, because you pressed the button. Yes, you do have responsibility for your own mouse clicks, but that doesn't absolve others of the moral duty to not steal your money. 

Those who would manipulate their victims through a bait-and-switch and then blame them for allowing it to happen in the first place deserve a special place in hell.(He's about to rugpull a memecoin)Best #Rugpull Award goes to token #TRUMP

A thread https://t.co/25dMhPZPlsGood afternoon dear friends 
🌷🌿🌷🌿🌷🌿🌷🌿🌷🌿🌷🌿🌷 https://t.co/5ZKMMeqCZw$IOTA is stepping up its DeFi game!

From tokenizing real-world assets to launching a fully decentralized on-chain order book DEX—big things are coming.

Curious to see how this plays out! https://t.co/fNarHiPoh0DeFi liquidity problem and the solution(Mitosis) @MitosisOrg 

DeFi allows people to lend, borrow, and trade assets without traditional banks, but it has some issues
-No Fair Pricing:Big users often get better deals,while smaller users lack information and access to good returns https://t.co/oNq4KgoHO2What can blochchain and decentrelized finance can brings a lots benefits to all users ?

Blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) can offer numerous benefits to users, including:
 
- **Security and Transparency**: Blockchain's distributed ledger technology ensures that all transactions are recorded on multiple computers, making it very difficult to alter or hack the data. This transparency helps in reducing fraud and increasing trust among users.
 
- **Disintermediation**: DeFi removes the need for traditional financial intermediaries like banks, brokers, or insurance companies. This can lead to faster transactions, lower fees, and direct control over one's financial assets.
 
- **Accessibility**: Anyone with internet access can potentially use DeFi services, which is particularly beneficial for those who are unbanked or underbanked, providing financial services to people in regions where traditional banking might not be accessible or efficient.
 
- **Decentralized Control**: Instead of centralized control by institutions, DeFi operates on smart contracts that automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met, reducing the risk of manipulation by any single entity.
 
- **Financial Inclusion**: By leveraging blockchain, DeFi can offer financial services like loans, savings, and insurance without the need for credit checks or other traditional barriers, thus broadening financial inclusion.
 
- **Innovation in Finance**: DeFi encourages innovation with new financial products like yield farming, liquidity pools, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing users with novel ways to invest, earn, and manage their assets.
 
- **Privacy**: Users can often transact with greater privacy, as personal identity isn't necessarily tied to blockchain transactions, although this varies with different DeFi platforms and regulations.
 
- **Portability**: Digital assets on blockchain are not bound by national borders, facilitating international transactions without the typical fees or delays associated with cross-border banking.
 
- **24/7 Operations**: Unlike traditional finance which operates within business hours, DeFi platforms can function around the clock, allowing for constant access to financial services.
 
- **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: In traditional finance, you rely on the solvency and honesty of the counterparty (e.g., a bank). In DeFi, smart contracts execute automatically, reducing this risk.
 
However, these benefits come with challenges like scalability issues, regulatory concerns, and the complexity of managing one's own keys or understanding smart contract risks. Users should approach DeFi with caution, ensuring they understand the technologies and the inherent risks involved.How DeFi is changing the banking system: a glimpse into the future

The traditional banking system has remained unchanged for decades: centralized structures, strict controls, and middlemen standing between you and your money. But with the advent of decentralized finance (DeFi), the world of finance is rapidly changing.

⚙️ DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a blockchain-based financial instrument that allows you to transact without banks or other intermediaries. 

✔️ The main advantages of DeFi over banks:

1️⃣ Accessibility for everyone. All you have is the internet and a cryptocurrency wallet? Great, you can already use DeFi's services. No bank accounts, credit histories or bureaucracy needed.
2️⃣ Transparency. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making them available for anyone to verify.
3️⃣ Minimal fees. Banks charge significant interest for transfers and account maintenance. DeFi has significantly lower costs.
4️⃣ Passive income. Staking and farming give you the opportunity to earn money on your crypto assets.

❓ How is DeFi changing the banking system?

- Elimination of middlemen. Instead of a bank, smart contracts are now at the center of the interaction. They automatically execute transactions without human intervention.
- Raising capital through tokens. Projects and companies can now raise money without IPOs or big loans.
- Globalization of finance. DeFi blurs borders - there is no difference where you are located to borrow or invest.DeFi borrowing and lending revolutionize finance by enabling users to borrow and lend without intermediaries, KYC, or fund custody.

Smart contracts on open blockchains offer greater efficiency, access, and transparency than CeFi platforms and traditional banks.Join me as I unravel some of the risk associated with DeFi👇

♧ Market Volatility 
One of the main risks in DeFi is the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, this means that the value of your investments can change dramatically in a short periodBy utilizing decentralized identity verification, DeFi protocols can reduce the risk of identity theft and impersonation, creating a safer environment for users to interact and transact.Benefits of #DeFi

1. Accessibility: DeFi is open to anyone with an internet connection and a #crypto #wallet, democratizing access to financial services.

2. Transparency: Transactions and #smart #contract code are publicly auditable on the #blockchain.

3. No Intermediaries: DeFi eliminates the need for #banks or financial institutions, reducing #fees and increasing #efficiency.

4. Programmability: Smart contracts enable complex financial products and automation that are not possible in traditional finance.

5. Financial Inclusion: DeFi can provide financial services to #unbanked or #underbanked populations. ⬇️DeFi platforms provide financial inclusion, liquidity, and flexibility, but are also associated with market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security risks, and liquidity risks, emphasizing the need for user education to navigate these platforms effectively.[🇬🇧] Meria is now part of the $TRUF Network as a node operator!
