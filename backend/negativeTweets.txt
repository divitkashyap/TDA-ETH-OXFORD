@E5Investing: Why am I so high on #Bitcoin?

Three simple reasonsðŸ‘‡:

-Itâ€™s decentralized. Itâ€™s democratized money, and isnâ€™t backed by any one government. Bitcoin operates without authority and is driven by supply and demand.

-Itâ€™s limited in nature (meaning there are only ever going to be 21 million coins). This makes #Bitcoinâ€™s inflation rate extremely predictable.

- #Bitcoin is the most widely accepted #cryptocurrency in the world, and itâ€™s just getting started!@wonderlandsza: Social and Cultural Environment
Selection Bias
Affirmation and Advocacy
Social Contagion Theory
Higher Access to Resources
Media Influence@DucuGavril: Modern Russia has adapted these strategies, leveraging technology and globalization to sow division and confusion on a global scale. 

These methods corrode societal trust, distort truth, and threaten democratic principles worldwide.
