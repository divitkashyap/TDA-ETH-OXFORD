Use 50% of initial investment to buy solid big market cap altcoins like $ETH $SOL $ADA $LINK $DOGE\n\n3. Put 20% into $SOL to trade memecoins in the trenches (get as educated as possible first)\n\n4. Put the remaining 30% into stable coins to buy on any big crashes\n\n5. Start dollar-cost averaging with a % of your income as part of your entry strategy\n\n6. Take small profits on the way up into stable coins to repeat #4\n\n7. Rotate some memecoin profits into long-term altcoin picks (these will hit hard during altcoin season)\n\n8. Stay consistent on learning, finding good groups/people, improving strategy, finding better tools etc.\n\n9. Regularly remind yourself of your goals and your entry/exit strategy and stick to it. Start pulling profits to your bank as you reach goals and the bull market progresses\n\n10. As your portfolio gets much bigger, start setting up some passive income through staking\n\nDon't neglect your health, lock in, and change your life forever in 2025 \ud83d\ude80",

        "Tweet": "The danger of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is the major tool for cybercrime, drug trade, and money laundering; it\u2019s the coin for crooks who seek to hide their financial dealings!\n\nBut there are other important dangers.\n\nCryptocurrency comes with significant risks, both for individual investors and for broader economic systems.  Here are the key dangers:\n\n1.   Extreme Volatility\n\u2022  Prices can skyrocket or crash unpredictably, leading to massive financial losses.\n\u2022  Examples: Bitcoin crashed over 80% in 2018 and Terra/LUNA collapsed in 2022, wiping out billions.\n\n2.   Fraud & Scams\n\u2022  Ponzi schemes: Fake crypto projects promising high returns. (e.g., BitConnect scam).\n\u2022  Pump-and-dump schemes: Groups artificially inflate prices before selling off, leaving others with worthless assets.\n\u2022  Rug pulls: Developers abandon a project after collecting investors\u2019 funds.\n\n3.   Lack of Regulation & Consumer Protections\n\u2022  Unlike banks, crypto exchanges can collapse without protection.\n\u2022  Example: FTX exchange bankruptcy (2022)\u2014users lost billions with no recourse.\n\n4.    Hacking & Security Risks\n\u2022  Crypto wallets and exchanges are prime targets for hackers.\n\u2022 bExample: Mt. Gox hack (2014)\u2014lost 850,000 Bitcoin (worth over $50 billion today).\n\u2022  No way to recover lost private keys\u2014once gone, funds are irretrievable.\n\n5.   Environmental Impact\n\u2022  Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries.\n\u2022   Heavy use of fossil fuels for mining increases carbon emissions.\n\n6.   Illegal Activities\n\u2022  Cryptocurrencies are used for money laundering, tax evasion, drug trade, and ransomware payments.\n\u2022  Dark web marketplaces like Silk Road relied on Bitcoin.\n\n7.   Market Manipulation\n\u2022  Whales (large holders) can control the market, causing artificial price swings.\n\u2022  Elon Musk\u2019s tweets have dramatically affected Dogecoin and Bitcoin prices. (This is well documented).  He likely owns much Bitcoin and Dogecoin, and thus has enormous influence over its behaviour.\n\n8.   Speculation Over Practical Use\n\u2022  Many cryptocurrencies lack real-world use beyond trading.\n\u2022   Only a few, like Ethereum, have practical applications (smart contracts, DeFi).\n\n9.   Loss of Funds Due to Human Error\n\u2022  Sending crypto to the wrong address is irreversible.\n\u2022  Forgetting or losing a private key means total loss of funds.\n\n10.   Government Crackdowns\n\u2022  Some countries ban or restrict crypto use (e.g., China, India).\n\u2022  Governments may introduce Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to replace decentralized cryptos.\n\nWhilst cryptocurrency offers decentralization and financial innovation, it also presents severe risks due to volatility, lack of protection, hacking threats, and legal uncertainties.\n\nUnless you want to support criminals, better wait investing/dealing in Cryptocurrency till it\u2019s better regulated.\n\nCryptocurrency is illegal in several countries, exactly for this reason.",
